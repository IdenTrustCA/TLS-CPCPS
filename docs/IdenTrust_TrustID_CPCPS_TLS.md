### Object Identifier

IdenTrust is the owner of a numeric identifier--Object Identifier (OID)---assigned by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) under {joint-iso-ccitt (2) country (16) USA (840) US-company (1) IdenTrust (113839) CP (0) TrustID-v2(6)}, which IdenTrust uses as a base arc to identify CPs, CPSs, and other documents, schemas, algorithms, etc. The OID arc for IdenTrust's implementation of the TrustID CP-CPS and associated Policy documents is 2.16.840.1.113839.

[Section 7.1.6](#certificate-policy-object-identifier) lists individual TLS Certificate OIDs recognized for use within the PKI established by this CP-CPS.

Root and ICAs governed by this CP-CPS are disclosed in the "IdenTrust TrustID Certificate Hierarchy" table of the "[IdenTrust Downloads and Drivers](https://www.identrust.com/support/downloads)" webpage.

## PKI Participants

This CP-CPS describes an open-but-bounded Public Key Infrastructure. It describes the rights and obligations of all Participants -- i.e., all persons and entities authorized under the CP-CPS to fulfill any of the following roles: PMA, CA, RA, CMA, Repository, Subscriber, and Authorized Relying Party.

### Certification Authorities

A Certification Authority (CA) is a trusted third party that attests to the binding between an identity and cryptographic Key Pair. CA functions primarily consist of the following:

-   Key management functions, such as Key Generation of CA Key Pairs, the secure management of CA Private Keys and the distribution of CA Public Keys;

-   Secure delivery of the CA Private Keys to Subscribers specifically ensuring Private Keys are maintained in Cryptographic Modules that are FIPS evaluated, and software based Private Keys will be created and maintained by the Subscriber;

-   Establishing an environment and procedure for Applicants and PKI Sponsors for Certificates to submit their Certificate applications (e.g., creating a web-based enrollment page);

-   The Identity Proofing of Individuals or entities applying for a Certificate;

-   The approval or rejection of Certificate applications;

-   The signing and Issuance of Certificates in response to approved Certificate applications;

-   The publication of Certificates in a Repository, where Certificates are made available for potential Relying Parties;

-   The initiation of Certificate Revocations, including Mass Revocation, either at the Subscriber's request or upon the entity's initiative;

-   The Revocation of Certificates, including by such means as issuing and publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or providing Revocation information via Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) when required, or other online methods; and

-   The Identity Proofing of Individuals or entities submitting requests to renew Certificates or seeking a new Certificate following a re-keying process, and processes set forth above for Certificates issued in response to approved renewal or re-keying requests.

IdenTrust as an Issuing CA is bound to act according to the terms of the CP-CPS.

### Registration Authorities

Each Issuing CA will remain ultimately responsible for all TrustID Certificates it issues. However, under this CP-CPS, the Issuing CA may subcontract registration and Identity Proofing functions to an Organization that agrees to fulfill the functions of an RA in accordance with the terms of this CP-CPS, and who will Accept TrustID Certificate applications and locally collect and verify Applicant identity information to be entered into a TrustID Certificate. An RA operating under this CP-CPS is only responsible for those duties assigned to it by the Issuing CA pursuant to an agreement with the Issuing CA or as specified in this CP-CPS. The Issuing CA may require a RA Organization to submit a Registration Practice Statement.

IdenTrust as Issuing CA is ultimately responsible for all TrustID Certificates it issues; however, under this CP-CPS, with the exception of [Section 3.2.2.4](#validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control), [Section 3.2.2.5](#authentication-for-an-ip-address), and [Section 3.2.6.3](#validation-of-email-address-authorization-or-control), IdenTrust may subcontract registration and Identity Proofing functions to an Organization that agrees to:

1.  Meet the qualification requirements of [Section 5.3.1](#qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements), when applicable to the delegated function;

2.  Retain documentation in accordance with [Section 5.5.2](#retention-period-for-archive);

3.  Abide by the other provisions of the TLS BR that are applicable to the delegated function; and;

4.  Comply with this CP-CPS or the Delegated Third Party's Registration Practice Statement that IdenTrust has verified, and complies with the TLS BR. IdenTrust may require an RA Organization to submit a Registration Practice Statement on an annual basis.

IdenTrust may delegate to an Enterprise RA to verify Certificate Requests from Subjects within the Enterprise RA's own Organization. IdenTrust does not Accept Certificate Requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied:

1.  IdenTrust may delegate to an Enterprise RA to verify Certificate Requests from Subjects within the Enterprise RA's own Organization. IdenTrust shall not Accept Certificate Requests authorized by an Enterprise RA unless the following requirements are satisfied: IdenTrust shall confirm that the requested FQDNs are within the Enterprise RA's verified Domain Namespace. If the Certificate Request includes a Subject name of a type other than a FQDN, IdenTrust shall confirm that the name is either that of the delegated enterprise, or an Affiliate of the delegated enterprise, or that the delegated enterprise is an agent of the named Subject. For example, the CA shall not issue a Certificate containing the Subject name "XYZ Co." on the authority of Enterprise RA "ABC Co.", unless the two companies are affiliated (see [Section 3.2.2](#authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity)) or "ABC Co." is the agent of "XYZ Co". This requirement applies regardless of whether the accompanying requested Subject FQDN falls within the Domain Namespace of ABC Co.'s Registered Domain Name.

2.  IdenTrust confirms that the subject:organizationName name is either that of the delegated Enterprise RA, or an Affiliate of the delegated Enterprise RA, or that the delegated Enterprise RA is an agent of the named Subject.

3.  For EV Server Certificates the final cross-correlation and due diligence requirements ofÂ [Section 3.2.2.13Â of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32213-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence) may be performed by a single person representing the Enterprise RA.

IdenTrust imposes these limitations as a contractual requirement on the Enterprise RA and monitor compliance by the Enterprise RA.

### Subscribers

A Subscriber is an entity to whom or to which a Digital Certificate is issued and who is legally bound by a Subscriber Agreement. Subscribers use IdenTrust's issued TLS Certificates to encrypt and authenticate communication with web browsers.

TrustID Certificates may be issued in conjunction with an Organization that has a relationship with the Subscriber; this is termed affiliation. The organizational affiliation will be indicated in the Certificate. IdenTrust contacts the Affiliated Organization's associate with a Certificate application to verify the affiliation at the time of Certificate application and requesting Revocation of the Certificate if the affiliation is no longer valid.

### Relying Parties

This CP-CPS is intended for the benefit of an Authorized Relying Party who is an Individual or Sponsoring Organization that has entered into the Authorized Relying Party Agreement and uses the Subscriber's Certificate to verify the integrity of a Digitally Signed message, to identify the creator of a message, to authenticate such Subscriber, or to establish confidential communications with the Subscriber. This is different than a Relying Party that does not enter into the Authorized Relying Party Agreement but still relies upon the Certificate for the verification and authentication purposes listed above.

Relying parties may check the relevant CRL or OCSP response when available, before relying on the information presented in the Certificate.

### Other Participants

#### Policy Management Authority (PMA)

The IdenTrust Policy Management Authority (PMA) oversees the adoption, administration, and application of the CP-CPS with all the PKI Participants. The IdenTrust PMA also has charge of the future development and amendment of this CP-CPS.

#### Certificate Manufacturing Authority (CMA)

The Issuing CA will remain ultimately responsible for the manufacture of TrustID Certificates. However, the Issuing CA may subcontract manufacturing functions to third party CMAs who agree to be bound by this CP-CPS.

IdenTrust is responsible for the manufacture of TrustID Certificates.

#### Repositories

The Issuing CA will perform the role and functions of the Repository. The Issuing CA may subcontract the performance of the Repository functions to a third party Organization that agrees to fulfill the functions of a Repository, and who agrees to be bound by this CP-CPS, but the Issuing CA remains responsible for the performance of those services in accordance with this CP-CPS.

IdenTrust will perform the role and functions of the Repository.

#### PKI Sponsors

A PKI Sponsor is an Individual who applies for a Certificate used by an Electronic Device but is not the Subscriber. This Individual is employed by or is an authorized agent of the Sponsoring Organization and acts on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization in relation to the Certificate, including but not limited to applying for such Certificate, completing the application and registration processes, retrieving such Certificate when it is issued, and other Certificate lifecycle events. When so, the PKI Sponsor is responsible for providing the information necessary (i.e., server or application name, Public Keys, equipment authorization or attributes, contact information, and other information) to complete the application and registration processes. The PKI Sponsor will also:

-   Sign and submit, or approve a Certificate Request on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization, and/or

-   Sign and submit a Subscriber Agreement on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization, and/or

-   Acknowledge and agree to the Certificate Terms of Use on behalf of the Sponsoring Organization.

#### Trusted Agents

A Trusted Agent is an entity authorized to act as a representative of a Sponsoring Organization in verifying Applicant or PKI Sponsor information during the registration process. Trusted Agents do not have automated interfaces with the CA systems but will work manually with RAs and IdenTrust to have Applicants/PKI Sponsors approved.

#### Delegated Third Parties

IdenTrust does not delegate CA activities to Delegated Third Parties which are not Enterprise RAs.

## Certificate Usage

### Appropriate Certificate Uses

Applications for which TrustID Certificates are suitable include, but are not limited to, applications that Provide authentication-based access and secure communication with online sources of information:

Domain Validation (DV): Verifies that the Subscriber has control over the domain but does not authenticate the Organization behind the website.

Organization Validation (OV): Verifies that the Certificate Subscriber has control over the domain and authenticate the Organization behind the website.

Extended Organization Validation (EV): Verifies that the Subscriber has control over the domain and does a comprehensive authentication of the Organization behind the website to meet strict industry standards set by the CA/Browser Forum.

Allowed uses are specified in the Key Usage and Extended Key Usage extensions of a Certificate and are documented in the Certificate Profiles. This section presents the uses for different Certificate types as identified by the Certificate Policy OID.

### Prohibited Certificate Uses

# PUBLICATION AND REPOSITORY RESPONSIBILITIES

The CA shall develop, implement, enforce, and at least once every 366 days update a CP and/or CP-CPS that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of the TLS BR.

IdenTrust develops, implements, enforces and at least once every 366 days, update its CP-CPS Policy document to ensure compliance with the latest approved version of the TLS BR.

Incremental version numbering and date change log are present both on the title page of each document and in the Table of [Section 1.2](#document-name-and-identification) as evidence of annual review, even when no other changes are made to the document.

## Repositories

The CA shall make Revocation information for Publicly Trusted Subordinate Certificates and Subscriber Certificates available in accordance with this Policy.

IdenTrust operates and maintains a Repository to support its TrustID PKI operations and to provide information concerning the status of all TrustID Certificates issued. The Repository consists of documents and signed objects made available on this website <https://identrust.com>. The information is documented in this section and the Certificate Profiles [Section 7](#certificate-crl-and-ocsp-profiles). See the next section for publication of Certificate Revocation information.

TrustID Certificates issued by IdenTrust contain pointers to locations where Certificate-related information is published including CRLs, as specified in [Section 2.3](#time-or-frequency-of-publication) for the frequency of publication of IdenTrust's Repository.

CRLs for Subordinate CA and Root CA Certificates are available at: <http://validation.identrust.com/crl/>.

Additionally, online Certificate status information may be available through IdenTrust's TrustID validation services through OCSP. If offered, the validation services can be found at: <https://commercial.ocsp.identrust.com>.

## Publication of Certification Information

The CA shall publicly disclose its CP and CPS or CP-CPS through an appropriate and readily accessible online means that is available on a 24x7 basis. The CA shall publicly disclose its CA business practices to the extent required by the CA's selected audit scheme (see [Section 8.4](#_TOPICS_COVERED_BY)).

The CA's CP and CPS or CP-CPS must be structured in accordance with the RFC 3647 and must include all material required by the RFC 3647.

The CA shall conform to the current version of the TLS BR. In the event of any inconsistency between the CA's CP, CPS or CP-CPS, the TLS BR, the TLS BR take precedence over this CP, CPS or CP-CPS.

The CA shall host test web pages that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with Subscriber Certificates that chain up to each Publicly-Trusted Root CA Certificate. At a minimum, the CA shall host separate web pages using server and EV Server Certificates that are i. valid, ii. revoked, and iii. Expired.

The following CA information is published and publicly available in the Repository:

-   Copy of the current CP-CPS;

-   Copy of the current TrustID Certificate Profiles

-   Archived copies of previously approved/published TrustID CP, CPS, CP-CPS; and

-   Other information related to IdenTrust (e.g., Application forms, Product Datasheets, Agreements, etc.).

The Repository with current and archived document versions is available on a 24X7 basis at:

<https://www.identrust.com/support/documents/TrustID>

This CP-CPS document is structured in accordance with the framework outlined in RFC 3647.

This CP-CPS conforms to the current version of the TLS BR. In the event of any inconsistency between this CP-CPS, the TLS BR, the TLS BR take precedence.

Issuer CAs shall host test web pages that allow Application Software Suppliers to test their software with Subscriber Certificates that chain up to each Publicly-Trusted Root CA Certificate.

The following webpage is available for testing Subscriber Certificates - valid, revoked, and expired - chaining up to the IdenTrust Publicly-Trusted root: <https://testssl.identrust.com/>

## Time or Frequency of Publication

The CA shall develop, implement, enforce, and annually update the CP and CPS or CP-CPS that describes in detail how the CA implements the latest version of the BR. The CA shall indicate conformance with this requirement by incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry, even if no other changes are made to the document.

All the information required by the CP-CPS to be published in the Repository is published as PDF immediately after such information is available to IdenTrust. TrustID Certificates are published immediately once they are accepted by the Subscriber. Information relating to the status of a TrustID Certificate is published in accordance with this CP-CPS.

When changes to the CP-CPS are implemented by the PMA, IdenTrust will codify these new practices into this CP-CPS and publish it upon approval by the IdenTrust PMA. The published CP-CPS documents are tracked by incrementing the version number and adding a dated changelog entry, even if no other changes are made to the document.

The PMA also reviews and updates this CP-CPS on an annual basis or more frequently when required, to include the most recent TLS BR, and/or browser's root store Policy.

## Access Controls on Repositories

The Issuing CA will not impose any read access controls on:

-   This Policy

-   The Issuing CA\'s CA Certificate

-   Past and current versions of the Issuing CA\'s CPS and

-   Current versions of WebTrust annual Audits.

The Issuing CA may impose read-only access controls on TrustID Certificates and Certificate status information, in accordance with provisions of this Policy.

IdenTrust does not impose any read access controls on IdenTrust\'s Root CA Certificate for its signing Key, this CP-CPS, and annual WebTrust audits as well as Certificates and status information. IdenTrust does, however, impose access controls to ensure the authentication of Subscribers with respect to their Certificate(s) and the status of such Certificate(s) and personal registration information, which is separately managed from the public Certificate and status Repository. Access is restricted in accordance with [Section 9.4](#privacy-of-personal-information).

# IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION

## Naming

### Types of Names

For TrustID Certificates, where the commonName is populated, the subject field must contain an X.500 Distinguished Name (DN). The DN must be unique for each subject entity certified by the CA as defined by the issuer field. If Subject naming information is present only in the subjectAltName extension, then the Subject Name must be an empty sequence and the subjectAltName extension must include the FQDN and must be flagged as critical.

IdenTrust only generates and signs Certificates that contain a non-null Subject Distinguished Name complying with the X.500 standard, and the TLS BR for naming.

### Need for Names to Be Meaningful

The contents of each Certificate Distinguished Name field must have an association with the authenticated name of the End Entity.

### Anonymity or Pseudonymity of Subscribers

Server Domain Validation (DV) Certificates do not name a Subscriber; rather these types of Certificates have subject fields identifying only Domain Names or device identification respectively (not people or Organizations). For these types of Certificates, relying parties mayÂ consider the Certificate Subscriber to be anonymous.

### Rules for Interpreting Various Name Forms

The Issuing CA may defer to a naming authority for guidance on name interpretation and subordination.

Distinguished Names in Certificates are interpreted using the X.500 series of specifications and ASN.1 syntax. Email names in the SAN extension are interpreted using RFC 5322, (formerly RFC 822), specifying the format of Internet email messages. Email Addresses and FQDNs can be resolved through Domain Name services (DNS). Sections 4.1.2.4 and 4.2.1.7 of RFC 5280 describe how character sets and strings are to be interpreted in Issuer and Subject fields, and Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extension. RFC 2253 explains how an X.500 Distinguished Name in ASN.1 is translated into a UTF-8 human-readable string representation, and RFC 2616 explains how to interpret Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) for HTTP references.

### Uniqueness of Names

The IdenTrust PMA is responsible for ensuring CAs and RAs enforce name uniqueness within the X.500 name space for which they have been authorized. Specifically, name uniqueness shall be enforced.

Name uniqueness within the IdenTrust TrustID space is enforced by IdenTrust's CA. IdenTrust and RAs enforce name uniqueness within the X.500 namespace for which they have been authorized. When other name forms are used, they too are allocated such that name uniqueness across the TrustID CA System is ensured.

IdenTrust uses the following name forms and allocates names within the Subscriber community to guarantee name uniqueness among current and past Subscribers for all Certificates:

-   Name uniqueness is enforced through the use of an additional naming attribute that is part of the Subscriber's Subject DN. This attribute is 2.5.4.5, which is the OID for the subject:SerialNumber.

-   The subject:SerialNumber value, along with the common name of the Subscriber, guarantees the uniqueness of the Certificate in the Repository.

-   For server Certificates the uniqueness of the Subject DN is ensured by the inclusion of the FQDN after verification of its registration with the Domain Registrar. The uniqueness of a Domain Name is controlled by Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).

-   As other methods and standard practices of guaranteeing name uniqueness emerge, to increase application interoperability of Certificates, IdenTrust may implement these as well.

By nature, a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) is unique. The FQDN is included in either the DN common name or the subjectAltName. However, this does not prevent devices from sharing a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) as the common name.

Wildcard forms are allowed, subject to the restrictions imposed by Application Software Suppliers programs.

### Recognition, Authentication, and Role of Trademarks

An End Entity is not guaranteed that its Distinguished Name or Subject Name will contain any requested trademark. The Issuing CA is not required to subsequently issue a new TrustID Certificate to the rightful owner of any name if the Issuing CA has already issued to that owner a TrustID Certificate containing a DN and Subject Name that is sufficient for identification within the PKI. The Issuing CA is not obligated to seek evidence of trademarks or court orders.

The Issuing CA should reserve the right to make all decisions regarding End Entity names in TrustID Certificates. If necessary, a party requesting a TrustID Certificate may be required to demonstrate its right to use a particular name. The Issuing CA will investigate and correct if necessary any name collisions brought to its attention. If appropriate, the Issuing CA will coordinate with and defer to the appropriate naming authority.

Applicants are prohibited from using names or marks that infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. An Applicant/PKI Sponsor is not guaranteed that its Certificate's Subject Name will contain any requested trademark, and an Applicant PKI Sponsor requesting a specific name may be required to demonstrate the right to the use of that name. IdenTrust may request evidence of ownership of trademarks or the findings and orders from courts or other tribunals. A Certificate will not be revoked merely because there is another rightful owner of a name or mark when the Subject Name is sufficient for identification within the PKI and are non-infringing or otherwise not deceptive. Without incurring any liability to an Applicant PKI Sponsor or Subscriber, IdenTrust may reject any application or revoke a Certificate because of a name or trademark dispute.

## Initial Identity Validation

The Issuing CA shall be responsible for performing the Identity Proofing of End Entities before the Issuance of TrustID Certificates. The Issuing CA performs Identity Proofing itself, aided by its LRAs, or by elected Enterprise RAs from Sponsoring Organizations, or may designate one or more institutions as RAs. RAs may designate one or more employees or agents, to be referred to as LRAs, and Trusted Agents may be nominated by Sponsoring Organizations and appointed by the Issuing CA or an RA to perform Identity Proofing in accordance with this Section.

IdenTrust is responsible for performing the Identity Proofing of End Entities before the Issuance of TrustID Certificates. IdenTrust performs Identity Proofing itself, aided by its LRAs, or by elected Enterprise RAs from Sponsoring Organizations, or may designate one or more institutions as RAs. RAs may designate one or more employees or agents, to be referred to as LRAs, and Trusted Agents may be nominated by Sponsoring Organizations and appointed by IdenTrust or an RA to perform Identity Proofing in accordance with the requirements below:

All documents and data provided for verifying the TrustID Certificate must not be used by the RA if the document or data was obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate or in the case of EV Server Certificates, the age of all data used to support renewals will not exceed the period specified in [Section 3.2.2.14.3 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#322143-age-of-validated-data).

For validation of Domain Names and IP Addresses any reused data, document, or completed validation are obtained no more than 398 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

### Method to Prove Possession of Private Key

No stipulation

### Authentication of Organization and Domain Identity

Requests by Sponsoring Organizations for Certificates are submitted electronically and must include the Organization's legal name and address. The minimum Identity Proofing required of a Sponsoring Organization includes confirmation that:

-   The Sponsoring Organization legally exists and has conducted business from the address listed in the Certificate application; and

-   The information contained in the Certificate application is correct.

The Identity Proofing process may include a review of official government records, an Attestation Letter, and/or engagement of a reputable third party vendor of business information to provide validation information concerning the Sponsoring Organization applying for the Certificate, such as:

-   Legal company name;

-   Registration Number (If included in the subject as serial number)

-   A registered Assumed Name (if included in the Subject)

-   An organizational unit Name (if included in the Subject)

-   An address of the Organization (if included in the Subject)

-   Type of entity;

-   Year of formation;

-   State/region and country Jurisdiction of Incorporation;

-   Names of directors and officers;

-   Full business address;

-   Telephone number;

-   Proof of good standing in the jurisdiction where the Applicant is incorporated or otherwise organized; and

-   The unique Organization identifier shall be included in the Certificate subject:organizationIdentifier as specified in the Certificate Profile.

#### Authentication of the Individual-Organization Affiliation

The Issuing CA may Issue Certificates to Applicants affiliated with a Sponsoring Organization.

IdenTrust will Issue Certificates to Applicants affiliated to a Sponsoring Organization. A Sponsoring Organization must not be an Individual acting in a personal, non-business capacity. The Sponsoring Organization need not be incorporated, but it must conduct business. An Individual acting in a business capacity as a sole proprietor, professional consultant, or fictitious entity (e.g., "DBA" as allowed by local law), may be considered "the Organization" for the purposes of populating the "O" attribute in the Subject field of the Certificate (for server Certificates, the DBA name of an Individual acting in a sole proprietorship must be verified and is required to populate the "O" attribute of the Certificate Profile). If the Applicant is located outside the United States of America, IdenTrust may impose, through the Subscriber Agreement, additional restrictions in view of other jurisdictions' laws governing privacy, consumer protection, and other rights of Individuals. For example, if an Applicant is located within the European community, the Subscriber Agreement may contain an additional attestation from the Applicant that the information provided shall be considered business data rather than personal data under European Directive 95/46/EC and/or that the Individual gives his/her unambiguous consent to the processing of such data by IdenTrust.

The affiliation between the Applicant and the Sponsoring Organization can be employment, agency, or a contractual relationship. After approval, an Applicant becomes a Subscriber. Because it is the Subscriber who holds the Private Key, any verifiable Digital Signature created by that Private Key is attributable to the Subscriber. Whether that Digital Signature can be viewed as the Sponsoring Organization's signature depends on whether the Subscriber as an Individual has authority to sign for the Sponsoring Organization in the transaction in question. That authority cannot be inferred from a Certificate issued by IdenTrust. IdenTrust does not Issue Certificates that assert roles or authorizations.

In other words, Certificates complying with this CP-CPS do not imply any grant of authority by the Sponsoring Organization. A Relying Party can infer from verification of a Digital Signature by reference to a Valid Certificate issued by IdenTrust that a Digital Signature is attributable to the Individual listed in that Certificate as the Subscriber. A Relying Party cannot, however, infer that the Individual as the Subscriber acted on behalf of the affiliated Sponsoring Organization from the Certificate; instead, additional documentation or evidence is required depending on the applicable law of agency.

Certificates issued by IdenTrust do not permit attribution of a Digital Signature to the Sponsoring Organization listed in that Certificate. However, LRAs and Trusted Agents will not approve Issuance of a Certificate to an Individual as the Subscriber without obtaining both of the following first with respect to the Certificate to be issued:

-   The approval of the Sponsoring Organization with which that Individual as the Subscriber is affiliated. The approval enables the Sponsoring Organization to manage its internal PKI and infrastructure, but it is not in itself a grant of any authority. In its contract with IdenTrust or the RA, the Sponsoring Organization provides such approval of such, and the contract is required to be executed by an officer or similarly authorized representative of the Sponsoring Organization; and

-   Verification of the existence of affiliation between the Sponsoring Organization and the Subscriber. This consists of verification of employment, contractual relationship, or agency. IdenTrust or the RA verifies this affiliation through a Sponsoring Organization's representative other than the PKI Sponsor, usually the Trusted Agent where such exists. Otherwise, IdenTrust or the RA initiates communication with the Sponsoring Organization using a Reliable Method of Communication. The contact used for verification within the Sponsoring Organization may be the human resources department or any Individual in a capacity within the Sponsoring Organization to confirm the affiliation.

IdenTrust or the RA records this confirmation in an auditable log.

In the case of Sponsor-Validated Certificates approved by an Enterprise RA, records maintained by the Enterprise RA shall be accepted as evidence of Individual identity.

IdenTrust issues Personal Certificates to Individuals having no organizational affiliation, or who are acting in a personal capacity and not a professional capacity; in this case, the authentication of the Application-Organization affiliation is not required and the practices explained in this section are not executed.

When processing EV Server Certificates, additional checks are performed based on [Section 3.2.2.11 of the EV TLS BR.](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32211-verification-of-certain-information-sources)

#### Authentication of Subscribing Organization Identity

Before approving the inclusion of Sponsoring Organization information in a Certificate, the LRA will verify that the Sponsoring Organization legally exists, the physical address where it conducts business, the type of entity under which it operates, or any other Reliable Method of Communication where its representatives can be contacted.

LRAs or Trusted Agents verify the existence and name of a Sponsoring Organization in one of the following ways:

1.  A reference to a source unrelated to the prospective Sponsoring Organization such as:

-   A secretary of state or other governmental registry such as a QGIS or QGTIS;

-   Commercial database of business information; or a

-   A third party database that is periodically updated, which IdenTrust has evaluated in accordance with [Section 3.2.4](#validation-of-individual-identity-acceptable-forms-of-identification-documents).

2.  Presentation to LRA of a copy of a document issued by a government agency attesting to the Sponsoring Organization's legal existence, together with reasonable proof of the authenticity of that document. Documents submitted for this purpose must be "fair on their face," i.e., bear no apparent indication of forgery, fraud, tampering, etc.;

3.  In the case of an Organization that is not registered with a state regulatory agency (such as a partnership or unincorporated association), a copy of the partnership agreement, association rules, Assumed Name registration, or other document attesting to the Organization's existence;

4.  LRA may independently obtain (without reference to the data provided by the Applicant or PKI Sponsor for a Certificate) the name, address, Email Address, and/or telephone number of the Organization, which are verified through a Reliable Method of Communication;

5.  A site visit by an LRA or a third party who is acting as an agent for IdenTrust; or

6.  An Attestation Letter by an authorized representative (e.g., a supervisor, administrative officer, information security officer, Authorizing Official, Certificate coordinator, etc.) of the Applicant/PKI Sponsor's employer that has been verified in accordance with this section, or by a person or entity certified by a government agency as being authorized to confirm Organization identities, provided that the Attestation Letter is checked to ensure legitimacy.

IdenTrust or, when applicable, RAs will keep evidence that their LRAs verified Organizational information including legal company name, type of entity, principal address (number and street, city, ZIP or postal code), Email Address or telephone number, and, when deemed necessary, Domain Name registration, a certified copy of the Certificate of registration issued by a Government Entity, date of formation, names of directors and officers.

IdenTrust reconfirms a Sponsoring Organization's existence based on the ongoing business relationship between IdenTrust and the Sponsoring Organization, which is maintained through correspondence or a payment stream and maintenance of a bank account.

Additional checks will be in place based on the requirements listed in [Section 3.2.2.4 of the EV TLS B.R](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#3224-verification-of-applicants-physical-existence).

##### Verification of DBA or Tradename

If the PKI Sponsor wants to include a DBA or tradename, the PKI Sponsor must first prove that they have the right to use that name. To fulfill this requirement an LRA must request at least one piece of evidence from the following list that confirms ownership of the DBA or tradename during the verification process:

1.  A letter/official legal document, phone call to an independently verified number, or an email from the domain registered to a government agency in the jurisdiction of the PKI Sponsor's Organization legal creation, existence, or recognition that validates the ownership of the DBA or tradename;

2.  A letter/official legal document, phone call to an independently verified phone number, or an Email Address from the domain registered to a verifiable third party source that validates the ownership of the DBA or tradename;

3.  A letter/official legal document, phone call to an independently verified phone number, or an Email Address from the domain registered to a government agency responsible for the management of such DBAs or tradenames;

4.  An Attestation Letter accompanied by documentary support that validates the ownership of the DBA or Organization name; and

5.  A Reliable Data Source.

All information obtained by this process will be uploaded to and retained electronically in the PKI Sponsor's application file in IdenTrust's or the RA's System. If the information is obtained through a phone call, the LRA must document the telephone number, the source it was obtained and verified through, and the name and title of the Individual that provided the information for the verification and place this information into the System through the related application account.

#### Verification of Country

The LRA will verify the country associated with the Subject by choosing one of the following processes:

-   Through verification processes conducted by the LRA of the PKI Sponsor and the Organization in [Section 3.2.2](#authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity) and [Section 3.2.2.1](#authentication-of-the-individual-organization-affiliation).

-   Verifying the ccTLD with the Domain Name Registrar listed by the PKI Sponsor

If the PKI Sponsor applies for a Domain Name that contains a 2-letter country code (ccTLD) (e.g., www.identrust.uk as opposed to www.identrust.com), this confirmation will be sought from the Domain Name level to which the ccTLD applies. This means that the LRA cannot obtain verification from www.identrust.com if the PKI Sponsor is applying for a Domain Name from [www.identrust.uk](http://www.identrust.uk).

PKI Sponsors requesting a Certificate that will contain the countryName field and the other Sponsoring Organization will be verified by the LRA using the processes listed in [Section 3.2.2](#authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity) and [Section 3.2.2.1](#authentication-of-the-individual-organization-affiliation).

IdenTrust may implement a process to screen proxy servers to prevent reliance upon IP addresses assigned in countries other than where the Applicant is actually located.

#### Validation of Domain Authorization or Control

Before issuing a TrustID Certificate, IdenTrust verifies the Applicant's control of the FQDN (s) or IP address(s) listed in the Certificate application using one or more of the validation methods listed below, maintaining a record of which of method was used, along with the relevant TLS BR version number used.

Additional checks and verification will be made for EV Server Certificate applications based on the requirements in [Section 3.2.2 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#322-authentication-of-organization-identity).

##### Validating the Applicant as a Domain Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

##### Email, Fax, SMS, or Postal Mail to Domain Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

##### Phone Contact with Domain Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Constructed Email to Domain Contact

The LRA confirms the Applicant's control over the FQDN by

(i) sending an email to one or more addresses created by using 'admin,' 'administrator,' 'webmaster,' 'hostmaster,' or 'postmaster' as the local part, followed by the at-sign ("@"), followed by an Authorization Domain Name, and

(ii) including a Random Value in the email, and

(iii) receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value.

Each email may confirm control of multiple FQDNs, provided the Authorization Domain Name used in the email is an Authorization Domain Name for each FQDN being confirmed.

The Random Value shall be unique in each email.

The email may be re-sent in its entirety, including the re-use of the Random Value, provided that its entire contents and recipient shall remain unchanged.

The Random Value shall remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation.

**Note:** Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the LRA may also Issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating wildcard Domain Names.

#####  Domain Authorization Document

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  AgreedâUpon Change to Website

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  DNS Change

The LRA confirms the Applicant's control over the FQDN by confirming the presence of a Random Value or Request Token in a DNS CNAME, TXT, or CAA record for either (1) an Authorization Domain Name; or (2) an Authorization Domain Name that is prefixed with a Domain Label that begins with an underscore character.

If a Random Value is used, the LRA shall provide a Random Value unique to the Certificate Request and shall not use the Random Value after (1) 30 days or (2) if the Applicant submitted the Certificate Request, the time frame permitted for reuse of validated information relevant to the Certificate (such as in [Section 4.2.1 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions) or [Section 3.2.2.14.3 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#322143-age-of-validated-data)).

When using this method, the LRA implements Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [Section 3.2.2.9 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration). To count as corroborating, a Network Perspective must observe the challenge information (i.e., Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

**Note:** Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the LRA may also Issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the Domain Labels of the validated FQDN. This method is suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

#####  IP Address

The LRA confirms the Applicant's control over the FQDN by confirming that the Applicant controls an IP Address returned from a DNS lookup for A or AAAA records for the FQDN in accordance with [Section 3.2.2.5](#authentication-for-an-ip-address).

When using this method, the LRA implements Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [Section 3.2.2.9 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration). To count as corroborating, a Network Perspective must observe the same IP Address as the Primary Network Perspective.

**Note:** Once the FQDN has been validated using this method, the LRA does not Issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN unless the LRA performs separate validations for each of those other FQDNs using authorized methods. This method is not suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

#####  Test Certificate

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  TLS Using a Random Value

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Any Other Method

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Validating Applicant as Domain Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Email to DNS CAA Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Email to DNS TXT Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Phone Contact with Domain Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Phone Contact with DNS TXT Record Phone Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Phone Contact with DNS CAA Phone Contact

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Agreed-Upon Change to Website v2

The LRA confirms the Applicant's control over the FQDN by verifying that the Request Token or Random Value is contained in the contents of a file.

1.  The entire Request Token or Random Value must not appear in the request used to retrieve the file, and

2.  The LRA must receive a successful HTTP response from the request (meaning a 2xx HTTP status code must be received).

The file containing the Request Token or Random Value:

1.  Must be located on the Authorization Domain Name, and

2.  Must be located under the "/.well-known/pki-validation" directory, and

3.  Must be retrieved via either the "http" or "https" scheme, and

4.  Must be accessed over an Authorized Port.

If IdenTrust follows redirects, the following apply:

1)  Redirects must be initiated at the HTTP protocol layer.

    a)  Redirects must be the result of a 301, 302, or 307 HTTP status code response, as defined in Section 6.4 of RFC 7231, or a 308 HTTP status code response, as defined in Section 3 of RFC 7538. Redirects must be to the final value of the Location HTTP response header, as defined in Section 7.1.2 of RFC 7231.

2)  Redirects must be to resource URLs with either via the "http" or "https" scheme.

3)  Redirects must be to resource URLs accessed via Authorized Ports.

If a Random Value is used, then:

1.  IdenTrust must provide a Random Value unique to the Certificate Request.

2.  The Random Value must remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation.

Except for Onion Domain Names, the LRA performing validations using this method implements Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified inÂ [Section 3.2.2.9 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration). To count as corroborating, a Network Perspective must observe the same challenge information (i.e.,Â Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

**Note**: The LRA must not Issue Certificates for other FQDNs that end with all the labels of the validated FQDN unless the LRA performs separate validations for each of those other FQDNs using authorized methods. This method is not suitable for validating Wildcard Domain Names.

#####  AgreedâUpon Change to Website â ACME

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  TLS Using ALPN

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  DNS Labeled with Account ID ACME

This domain validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#### Authentication for an IP Address

IdenTrust as Issuing CA shall confirm that before Issuance, it has validated each IP Address listed in the Certificate Application using at least one of the methods specified in this section.

Completed validations of Applicant authority may be valid for the Issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation must have been initiated within the period specified in the relevant requirement such as those in [Section 4.2.1](#performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), before Certificate Issuance. For purposes of IP Address validation, the term Applicant includes the Applicant's parent company, subsidiary company, or Affiliate.

IdenTrust shall maintain a record of which IP validation method, including the relevant B.R. version number that was used to validate every IP Address.

#####  Agreed-Upon Change to Website

The LRA confirming the Applicant's control over the requested IP Address by confirming the presence of a Random Value contained in the content of a file or webpage in the form of a meta tag under the "/.well-known/pki-validation" directory, or another path registered with IANA for the purpose of validating control of IP Addresses, on the IP Address that is accessible by the CA via HTTP/HTTPS over an Authorized Port.

The Random Value:

1.  Must not appear in the request

2.  Must be unique to the Certificate Request and

3.  Must not be used after the longer of

    a.  30 days or

    b.  if the Applicant submitted the Certificate Request, the timeframe permitted for reuse of validated information relevant to the Certificate such as those in [Section 4.2.1](#performing-identification-and-authentication-functions).

The LRA performing validations using this method must implement Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration as specified in [Section 3.2.2.9 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration). To count as corroborating, a Network Perspective must observe the same challenge information (i.e., Random Value or Request Token) as the Primary Network Perspective.

#####  Email to IP Address Contact

The LRA confirms the Applicant's control over the IP Address by sending a Random Value via email and then receiving a confirming response utilizing the Random Value. The Random Value must be sent to an Email Address identified as an IP Address Contact.

Each email may confirm control of multiple IP Addresses.

The LRA may send the email identified under this section to more than one recipient provided that every recipient is identified by the IP Address Registration Authority as representing the IP Address Contact for every IP Address being verified using the email.

The Random Value shall be unique in each email.

The LRA may resend the email in its entirety, including re-use of the Random Value, provided that the communication's entire contents and the recipient(s) remain unchanged.

The Random Value shall remain valid for use in a confirming response for no more than 30 days from its creation.

#####  Reverse Address Lookup

This IP Address validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Any other Method

This IP Address validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  Phone Contact with IP Address Contact

This IP Address validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  ACME "http-01" method for IP Addresses

This IP Address validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#####  ACME "http-01" method for IP Addresses

This IP Address validation method is not used by IdenTrust.

#### Wildcard Domain Validation

Before issuing a wildcard Certificate with a FQDN, the control of the entire Domain Namespace delimited by the FQDN will be verified by an IdenTrust LRA through a combination of manual and automatic checks to determine whether the wildcard character is placed immediately to the left of a Reliable Data Source or Public Suffix. To perform such verification, the IdenTrust LRA will use the public list of suffixes available in [https://publicsuffix.org/](%20https://publicsuffix.org/) and shall use additional sources as IdenTrust may specify to the IdenTrust LRA from time to time. For example, FQDNs such as "\*.co.tz" or "\*.k12.ut.us" cannot be accepted since in each case the wildcard is immediately to the left of a suffix in the list available at <https://publicsuffix.org/>.

For some gTLDs, the entire Domain Namespace may be controlled by one Subscribing Organization (e.g., ". Cisco," ". IBM"). If that rare case needs to be addressed, the process in the section below is completed first and the Subscribing Organization will provide written assertions about the rightful control over the entire Domain Namespace. See [Section 3.2.2.6.1](#verification-of-gtld-domains) below Verification of gTLD Domains

##### Verification of gTLD Domains

IdenTrust does not issue server Certificates containing general top-level Domain Names (gTLDs) that are not currently approved or in the process of being approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). FQDNs containing a gTLD that has not been approved will be rejected in the application process until ICANN finalizes the approval of the gTLD.

IdenTrust does not issue server Certificates for Reserved IP Addresses, or internal server names and will not issue them for the gTLD domains not approved on these grounds. IdenTrust does not issue server Certificates to Internal Names including those that may contain an unassigned gTLD.

#### Data Source Accuracy

Prior to using any data source as a Reliable Data Source, IdenTrust evaluate the source for its reliability, accuracy, and resistance to alteration or falsification. The following factors are considered for this evaluation:

1.  The age of the information provided,

2.  The frequency of updates to the information source,

3.  The data provider and purpose of the data collection,

4.  The public accessibility of the data availability, and

5.  The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

IdenTrust or the RA may rely upon an Attestation Letter attesting that Subject Information or other fact is correct. IdenTrust or the RA shall verify that the Attestation Letter was written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party in the Applicant's jurisdiction customarily relied upon for such information.

An Attestation Letter shall include a copy of documentation supporting the fact to be attested. IdenTrust or the RA shall use a Reliable Method of Communication to contact the sender and to confirm the Attestation Letter is authentic.

#### CAA Records

As part of the Certificate Issuance process, the CA must retrieve and process CAA records in accordance with RFC 8659 for eachÂ dNSNameÂ in theÂ subjectAltNameÂ extension that does not contain an Onion Domain Name.

See [Section 4.2.1.1](#_CAA_Checking), CAA Checking.

#### Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration

Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration attempts to corroborate the determinations (i.e., domain validation pass/fail, CAA permission/prohibition) made by the Primary Network Perspective from multiple remote Network Perspectives before Certificate Issuance.

IdenTrust uses either the same set, or different sets of Network Perspectives when performing Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration for the required:

1.  Domain Authorization or Control and

2.  CAA Record checks.

The set of responses from the relied upon Network Perspectives provides IdenTrust with the necessary information to allow it to affirmatively assess:

1.  The presence of the expected

    i.  Random Value,

    ii. Request Token

    iii. IP Address, or

    iv. Contact Address, as required by the relied upon validation method specified in Sections [Section 3.2.2.4](#validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control) and [Section 3.2.2.5](#authentication-for-an-ip-address); and

2.  IdenTrust's authority to issue to the requested domain(s), as specified in [Section 3.2.2.8](#caa-records).

Results or information obtained from one Network Perspective is not to be reused or cached when performing validation through subsequent Network Perspectives (e.g., different Network Perspectives cannot rely on a shared DNS cache to prevent an adversary with control of traffic from one Network Perspective from poisoning the DNS cache used by other Network Perspectives). The network infrastructure providing Internet connectivity to a Network Perspective may be administered by the same Organization providing the computational services required to operate the Network Perspective. All communications between a remote Network Perspective and IdenTrust take place over an authenticated and encrypted channel relying on modern protocols (e.g., over HTTPS).

A Network Perspective may use a recursive DNS resolver that is not co-located with the Network Perspective. However, the DNS resolver used by the Network Perspective must fall within the same Regional Internet Registry service region as the Network Perspective relying upon it. Furthermore, for any pair of DNS resolvers used on a Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration attempt, the straight-line distance between the two DNS resolvers must be at least 500 km. The location of a DNS resolver is determined by the point where unencapsulated outbound DNS queries are typically first handed off to the network infrastructure providing Internet connectivity to that DNS resolver.

IdenTrust may immediately retry Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using the same validation method or an alternative method. When retrying Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration, IdenTrust does not rely on corroborations from previous attempts. There is no stipulation regarding the maximum number of validation attempts that may be performed in any period of time.

The "Multi-Perspective Quorum Requirements" table below describes quorum requirements related to Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration. If IdenTrust does not rely on the same set of Network Perspectives for both Domain Authorization or Control and CAA Record checks, the quorum requirements will be met for both sets of Network Perspectives (i.e., the Domain Authorization or Control set and the CAA record check set). Network Perspectives are considered distinct when the straight-line distance between them is at least 500 km. Network Perspectives are considered "remote" when they are distinct from the Primary Network Perspective and the other Network Perspectives represented in a quorum.

IdenTrust can reuse corroborating evidence for CAA record quorum compliance for a maximum of 398 days. After issuing a Certificate to a domain, remote Network Perspectives may omit retrieving and processing CAA records for the same domain or its subdomains in subsequent Certificate Requests from the same Applicant for up to a maximum of 398 days.

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Multi-Perspective Quorum Requirements**

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remote Network Perspectives performing Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration must rely upon networks (e.g., Internet Service Providers or Cloud Provider Networks) implementing measures to mitigate BGP routing incidents in the global Internet routing system for providing Internet connectivity to the Network Perspective.

For Certificates issued on or after March 15, 2025, IdenTrust implements Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using at least two (2) remote Network Perspectives. IdenTrust may proceed with Certificate Issuance if the number of remote Network Perspectives that do not corroborate the determinations made by the Primary Network Perspective ("non-corroborations") is greater than allowed in the "Multi-Perspective Quorum Requirements" table above.

For Certificates issued on or after March 15, 2026, IdenTrust will implement Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using at least three (3) remote Network Perspectives. IdenTrust will ensure that the requirements defined in the "Multi-Perspective Quorum Requirements" table above are satisfied, and the remote Network Perspectives that corroborate the Primary Network Perspective fall within the service regions of at least two (2) distinct Regional Internet Registries.

For Certificates issued on or after June 15, 2026, IdenTrust will implement Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using at least four (4) remote Network Perspectives. IdenTrust will ensure that the requirements defined in the "Multi-Perspective Quorum Requirements" table above are satisfied, and the remote Network Perspectives that corroborate the Primary Network Perspective fall within the service regions of at least two (2) distinct Regional Internet Registries.

For Certificates issued on or after December 15, 2026, the IdenTrust will implement Multi-Perspective Issuance Corroboration using at least five (5) remote Network Perspectives. IdenTrust will ensure that the requirements defined in Quorum Requirements table above are satisfied, and the remote Network Perspectives that corroborate the Primary Network Perspective fall within the service regions of at least two (2) distinct Regional Internet Registries.

### Authentication of Individual Identity

If an Applicant for a TrustID Certificate is Natural Person, then IdenTrust shall verify the Applicant's name, Applicant's address, and the authenticity of the Certificate Request.

IdenTrust shall verify the Applicant's name using a legible copy, which discernibly shows the Applicant's face, of at least one currently valid government-issued photo ID (passport, driver's license, military ID, national ID, or equivalent document type). IdenTrust shall inspect the copy for any indication of alteration or falsification.

IdenTrust shall verify the Applicant's address using a form of identification that IdenTrust CA determines to be reliable, such as a government ID, utility bill, or bank or credit card statement. IdenTrust may rely on the same government-issued ID that was used to verify the Applicant's name.

IdenTrust shall verify the Certificate Request with the Applicant using a Reliable Method of Communication.

#### Validation of Individual Identity -- Acceptable Forms of Identification Documents

The CA or RA shall validate all identity attributes of the Individual to be included in the Certificate.

If the evidence has an explicit Validity Period, the CA shall verify that the time of the identity validation is within this Validity Period. In context this can include theÂ notBeforeÂ andÂ notAfterÂ fields of a Digital Signature Certificate or the date of expiry of an identity document.

The CA or RA may reuse existing evidence to validate Individual identity subject to the age restrictions inÂ [Section 4.2.1](#performing-identification-and-authentication-functions).

All Individuals seeking the Issuance of a TrustID Certificate who apply in person or in an in-person Remote Identity Proofing event must present satisfactory proof of identity using documents which discernible show the Applicant's face.

The following are considered by the TrustID Policy to be acceptable "Government-issued photo IDs" in its original form for in-person and Remote Identity Proofing (all photo IDs must be currently-valid (e.g., unexpired) at the time of presentment by the Applicant for Identity Proofing)

-   A government-issued driver's license or non-driver's license identification card;

-   A passport;

-   A military ID;

-   An alien registration card or naturalization Certificate (with photograph);

-   A national health card (with photograph); and

-   Any other currently valid photo ID issued by a governmental agency.

The following are considered by the TrustID CP and this CPS to be other "Acceptable Forms of ID":

-   A current college photo identification card;

-   An employer identification card (with photograph);

-   A social security or national health card (without a photograph);

-   An original or certified copy of a birth Certificate;

-   An original or certified copy of a court order with name and date of birth;

-   A utility bill invoiced within the last 60 days that contains a matching name and address;

-   An insurance Policy containing name and date of birth;

-   A voter registration card;

-   A concealed handgun license;

-   A pilot's license;

-   A marriage license;

-   A high school or college diploma; and

-   Third party affidavits of identity based on personal acquaintance with the Applicant/PKI Sponsor.

### Non-Verified Subscriber information

IdenTrust does not include unverified Subscriber information in TrustID Certificates. This principle is enforced by the Certificate Profiles specified in the TrustID Certificate Profile, which only allow certain information to be included in Certificates. The processes described in [Section 3](#identification-and-authentication) and [Section 4](#certificate-life-cycle-operational-requirements) prevent any information that is not verified to be included in the Certificate.

### Validation of Authority

Certificates issued to Subscribers do not assert authority to act on behalf of an Organization in an implied capacity.

During the Domain Name validation procedure for any method described in [Section 3.2.2.4](#validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control), the Domain Contact will be asked if they would like to provide a list of Individuals authorized to apply for a Certificate for that Domain Name and/or any additional FQDNs verified under their control. Individuals that apply for FQDNs provided by the Domain Contact that are not named on such a list, will not be authorized to request a Certificate for that Domain Name. The Domain Contact will be eligible to update this list based on any business needs upon contacting or being contacted and verified by the LRA.

IdenTrust may use the sources listed in [Section 3.2.5.2.](#disclosure-of-verification-sources)

Provided that IdenTrust uses a Reliable Method of Communication, IdenTrust may establish the authenticity of the Certificate Request directly with the Applicant Representative or with an authoritative source within the Applicant's Organization, such as the Applicant's main business offices, corporate offices, human resource offices, information technology offices, or other department that IdenTrust deems appropriate.

#### Verification of the Certificate Request

When evaluating the authenticity of a Certificate Request, the LRA or Enterprise RA will establish the verification directly with the Applicant/PKI Sponsor. Any information collected during the verification process by the LRA or Enterprise RA will be placed into the System for documentation purposes. The source of verification will depend upon the type of Certificate Requested.

If a Certificate Request is being submitted to an Enterprise RA, verification of the Certificate Request is completed by the Enterprise RA. The Enterprise RA will contact the PKI Sponsor via the company/Organization internal directory or telephone list that is maintained by the human resources department or similar authority. Equivalent processes to fulfill this verification may be approved by the PMA and documented by the Sponsoring Organization with Enterprise RAs. The Enterprise RA will request to speak to the PKI Sponsor at the Sponsoring Organization telephone number and upon confirming identity, will ask the PKI Sponsor to verify the validity of the request.

Additional checks and verification will be made for EV Server Certificate applications based on [Section 3.2.2.1.1 of the EV TLS B.R.](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32211-verification-requirements--overview)

#### Disclosure of Verification Sources

For Organization-Validated Certificates, IdenTrust verifies the unique Organization identifier used in the Certificate from a register that is maintained or authorized by the relevant government agency.

IdenTrust may use third party vendors to obtain regularly updated and current information from the government register provided that the third party obtains the information directly from the government.

For validation of Organizations that apply for EV Server, at the time of Certificate Issuance, IdenTrust documents and publishes the applicable incorporating agency or Registration Agency used as validation source to validate the applying Organization at this location:

[https://www.identrust.com/support/documents/TrustID](https://www.identrust.com/support/documents/trustid).

The "Organization Verification Sources" document is located in the "Product Datasheets" Section.

#### Reliability of Verification Sources

Before relying on a source of verification data to validate Certificate Requests, IdenTrust verifies its suitability as a Reliable Data Source. Enterprise RA records are a Reliable Data Source for Individual Subject attributes included in Sponsor-Validated Certificates issued to the Enterprise RA's Organization.

The RA may rely upon an Attestation Letter attesting that Subject Information or other fact is correct. The RA shall verify that the Attestation Letter was written by an accountant, lawyer, government official, or other reliable third party in the Applicant's jurisdiction customarily relied upon for such information.

An Attestation Letter shall include a copy of documentation supporting the fact to be attested. The RA shall use a Reliable Method of Communication to contact the sender and to confirm the Attestation Letter is authentic.

#### Verification and Validation of Certificate Information Sources

In addition to the verification of information, by comparison to trusted information as described above, two additional verifications of information may be conducted before Issuance to verify the information provided by the PKI Sponsor:

-   High risk domain requests will be checked against a third party authority as described in [Section 4.2.1.3](#high-risk-request-procedure); and

-   High-risk denials, as documented in [Section 4.2.2](#approval-or-rejection-of-certificate-applications), are prior requests that have been denied and are deemed as high risk due to suspected phishing or other fraudulent usage or concerns are maintained in an internal list. Subsequent Certificate Requests will be verified against this list.

-   Additional checks are performed for EV Server Certificates based on

[Section 3.2.2.11 of the EV TLS BR.](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32211-verification-of-certain-information-sources)Should a third party vendor be utilized to confirm the information provided manually or electronically, IdenTrust or the RA will evaluate the third party source by these required criteria:

1.  Data it contains that will be relied upon has been independently verified

2.  The database distinguishes between self-reported data and data reported by independent information sources; and

3.  Changes in the data that will be relied upon will be reflected in the database in no more than 12 months.

In addition, the following criteria will be taken into account while reviewing the information taken from the third party source:

-   The age of the information provided;

-   The frequency of updates to the third party database;

-   The data provided and purpose of the data collection;

-   The public accessibility of the data availability; and

-   The relative difficulty in falsifying or altering the data.

### Criteria for Interoperation

IdenTrust as CA shall adhere to the following requirements:

-   Operate a PKI that has undergone a successful compliance audit pursuant to [Section 8](#compliance-audit-and-other-assessments);

-   Issue Certificates interoperable with the profiles described in [Section 7](#certificate-crl-and-ocsp-profiles), and make Certificate status information available in compliance with this CP-CPS;

-   Provide CA Certificate and Certificate status information to the Authorized Relying Parties; and

-   Disclose all Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificates that identify the CA as the Subject, provided that it has arranged for or accepted the establishment of the trust relationship (i.e., the Cross-Certified Subordinate CA Certificate at issue).

#### Cross-Certification

Upon PMA approval, when cross-certification between an IdenTrust root with an external Certification Authority takes place, IdenTrust must inform End Entities of the uses allowed within the cross-certified PKI.

#### Verification and Validation of Information

Verification and validation of registration information shall consist of a comparison of registration information with trusted information, and an out-of-band confirmation process. The comparison may be performed electronically or through other trusted means (e.g., a manual review by an LRA after receiving a printout of the online application by mail).

The "trusted information" used for comparison for manual and automated electronic verification described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation). Initial Identity Validation may consist of either (i) a database of user-supplied information previously compiled and maintained by IdenTrust or the RA based on an antecedent identification of and continuing relationship with the user; (ii) information provided through third party vendors of such information; or (iii) a Qualified Government Information Source or Qualified Government Tax Information Source.

Once a source is deemed to be within the acceptable parameters of accuracy and reliability it will be used for verification purposes.

The "out-of-band confirmation process" may consist of (i) delivery of a Shared Secret to a confirmed and trusted data point (e.g., street address, telephone number, or Email Address), (ii) delivery in-person of a Shared Secret upon presentment of at least 2 acceptable forms of identification in accordance with [Section 3.2.3.1](#validation-of-individual-identity-acceptable-forms-of-identification-documents), (iii) use of a Shared Secret between the Individual identified in the application and the CA or RA pursuant to an antecedent identification and ongoing relationship, (iv)Â presentation by the Applicant/PKI Sponsor during the application process of information that the CA or RA can be reasonably assured would be known only to the person identified in the application; or (v) another equivalent process.

Any documents received for the manual verification process will be inspected by the LRA for signs of alteration or falsification. The contents of the request will also need to be verified for quality and accuracy.

#### Validation of Email Address Authorization or Control

Email verification when required can be done in 2 ways; electronically and manually through a list submitted by a Trusted Agent. If the application for a Certificate requires email verification, the application cannot be approved until the specified steps for electronic or manual verification are complete.

IdenTrust verifies that Applicant controls the email accounts associated with TLS Certificates and that Email Address fields referenced in the Certificate have been authorized by the email account holder to act on the account holder's behalf.

IdenTrust does not delegate the verification of Email Addresses authorization or control. IdenTrust shall maintain a record of the validation method, including the relevant version number from the TLS BR that was used to validate every domain or Email Address in issued Certificates.

##### Electronic Verification of Email

######  Validating Control Over Email Address Via Email

Upon submission of an application via a secure online form, an automated email is dispatched to the specified Email Address provided within the application. Contained within this automated email is a link leading the Applicant/PKI Sponsor to a server-authenticated TLS secured website. Detailed within are instructions guiding the Applicant/PKI Sponsor to furnish a single-use email verification Random Value, which remains valid for a duration of 24 hours. Alongside this, the Account Password -- created during the application process by the Applicant/PKI Sponsor -- is required.

The Account Password, held exclusively by the Applicant/PKI Sponsor, and the Random Value must be entered within 24 hours of Issuance. This act finalizes the verification process for the Email Address and subsequently triggers an automatic update of the verification status within the Applicant/PKI Sponsor's application record.

Should the allotted 24-hour window expire, rendering the Random Value void, a new Random Value shall be transmitted to the Applicant's Email Address, thereby rendering the previous Random Value invalid.

###### Manual Verification of Email

Enterprise RAs may furnish a list of authorized sponsored Applicants/PKI Sponsors. These Individuals have their Email Addresses verified by a Trusted Agent, drawing upon the internal insights of the Sponsoring Organization. The Trusted Agent employs internal databases and directories to ascertain the correctness of email information.

For server Domain validations, IdenTrust maintains a record of the TLS BR validation method used, including the relevant version number. The TLS BR validation methods are not used for Email Address validation.

Completed validations of Applicant authority may be valid for the Issuance of multiple Certificates over time. In all cases, the validation is handled within the time period specified in [Section 4.2.1](#performing-identification-and-authentication-functions) prior to Certificate Issuance.

## Identification and Authentication for Re-Key Requests

### Identification and Authentication for Routine Re-Key

For End Entity Certificates, a request for Issuance of a new TrustID Certificate with a new Key Pair is available within 30 days before Certificate expiration.

### Identification and Authentication for Re-Key after Revocation

Revoked, or expired TrustID Certificates cannot be re-keyed, renewed, or updated. Applicants/PKI Sponsors without a valid TrustID Certificate will be re-authenticated by IdenTrust; or an LRA, Enterprise RA, or Trusted Agent, through a new TrustID Certificate application according to the corresponding Certificate based on [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation), just as with an initial Applicant registration, and will be issued a new TrustID Certificate.

## Identification and Authentication for Revocation Requests

The identity of the person submitting a Revocation, including MRE, or suspension request in any other manner is authenticated in accordance with [Section 4.9](#certificate-revocation-and-suspension)

# CERTIFICATE LIFE-CYCLE OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## Certificate Application

### Who Can Submit a Certificate Application

The Certificate application process may be initiated by an Affiliated Individual.

A Certificate application may be submitted by various Individuals depending on the type of Certificate as described below:

-   An Individual who is already a Subscriber of this type of Certificate.

-   The Sponsoring Organization through an authorized representative (e.g., Trusted Agent).

-   Server and Electronic Device Certificates

-   An Individual who is already a Subscriber, or who can fulfill the same requirements of a Subscriber though it does not obtain a human Certificate, and when appropriate, who has been authorized by the Sponsoring Organization to be the PKI Sponsor for the Device.

-   Additional checks and requirements for the Applicant for EV Server Certificates Subjects are made in accordance with [Section 4.1.1 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#411-who-can-submit-a-certificate-application).

### Enrollment Process and Responsibilities

Prior to the Issuance of a Certificate, IdenTrust obtains the following from the Applicant:

1.  A Certificate Request;

2.  An executed Subscriber Agreement and/or Terms of Use; and

3.  Payment of any applicable fees

The Certificate Request and Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use comply with [Section 9.6.3 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#963-subscriber-representations-and-warranties). When applicable, IdenTrust obtain any additional documentation necessary to fulfill the Certificate Request.

One Certificate Request may suffice for multiple Certificates to be issued to the same Applicant, subject to the validation reuse periods described in [Section 4.2.1](#performing-identification-and-authentication-functions), provided that each Certificate is supported by a valid, current Certificate Request signed by the appropriate Applicant Representative on behalf of the Applicant.

The Certificate Request contains a request from, or on behalf of, the Applicant for the Issuance of a Certificate, and a certification by, or on behalf of the Applicant that all of the information contained therein is correct.

IdenTrust may rely on a previously verified Certificate Request to issue a replacement Certificate if:

1.  The previous Certificate being referenced was not revoked;

2.  The expiration date of the replacement Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced; and

3.  The Subject Information of the Certificate is the same as the previous Certificate being referenced.

IdenTrust has designed enrollment processes that facilitate the submission of registration information from the Applicant/PKI Sponsor to IdenTrust. Options include but are not limited to: Direct submission over a TrustID dedicated website; Trusted-Agent-mediated submission in bulk, Enterprise RA-mediated submission in bulk to IdenTrust, and submission through an RA that is securely forwarded to IdenTrust.

## Certificate Application Processing

An Applicant/PKI Sponsor for a TrustID Certificate completes a TrustID Certificate application and provides requested information in a form prescribed by this CP-CPS.

Information in the Certificate application is verified as accurate before Certificates are issued as specified in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation).

### Performing Identification and Authentication Functions

The Certificate Request may include all factual information about the Applicant to be included in the Certificate, and such additional information as is necessary for the CA to obtain from the Applicant in order to comply with the TLS BR and this CP-CPS. In cases where the Certificate Request does not contain all the necessary information about the Applicant, the CA shall obtain the remaining information from the Applicant or, having obtained it from a reliable, independent, third-party data source, confirm it with the Applicant. The CA shall establish and follow a documented procedure for verifying all data requested for inclusion in the Certificate by the Applicant.

The Identity Proofing information for a Subscriber is collected and examined by IdenTrust, a Trusted Agent from the Organization sponsoring the Subscriber, Enterprise RA or an LRA of the RA identified in [Section 1.3.2](#registration-authorities). Such information is verified according to the Identity Proofing processes described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation) and [Section 3.3](#identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests).

Applicant information must include, but not be limited to, at least one Fully Qualified Domain Name or IP Address to be included in the Distinguished Name or Certificate's subjectAltName extension. If FQDN is only included in the subjectAltName extension, that extension must be marked as critical

For EV Server Certificates, IdenTrust follows the identification and authentication functions as described in [Section 4.2.1 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions).

IdenTrust may use the documents and data provided in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation) to verify Certificate information or may re-use previous validations themselves provided that the data or document used in the prior validation is no more than 3987 days before issuing the Certificate. For EV Server Certificates, the age of all data used to support renewals shall not exceed more than 13 (thirteen) months as specified in [Section 3.2.2.14.3 of the EV TLS BR.](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#322143-age-of-validated-data) IdenTrust may reuse completed validations and/or supporting evidence performed in accordance with [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation) within the following limits:

1.  **Authentication of Organization Identity**: Completed validation of organization identity in accordance with [Section 3.2.2](#authentication-of-organization-and-domain-identity) shall be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

> Validation of authority in accordance with [Section 3.2.5](#validation-of-authority) shall be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate, unless a contract between the CA and the Applicant specifies a different term. For example, the contract may include the perpetual assignment of roles until revoked by the Applicant or CA, or until the contract expires or is terminated.

2.  **Authentication of Individual Identity**: Completed validation of Individual identity in accordance with [Section 3.2.3](#multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration) shall be obtained no more than 825 days prior to issuing the Certificate.

A prior validation shall not be reused if any data or document used in the prior validation was obtained more than the maximum time permitted for reuse of the data or document prior to issuing the Certificate.[]{#_CAA_Checking .anchor}

#### CAA Checking

As part of the Server Certificate Issuance process, IdenTrust retrieves and process CAA records in accordance with RFC 8659 for each dNSName in the subjectAltName extension that does not contain an Onion Domain Name.

Some methods relied upon for validating the Applicant's ownership or control of the subject domain(s) (see [Section 3.2.2.4 the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3224-validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control)) or IP address(es) (see [Section 3.2.2.5](#authentication-for-an-ip-address) of the TLS BR) to be listed in a Certificate require CAA records to be retrieved and processed from additional remote Network Perspectives before Certificate Issuance (see [Section 3.2.2.9 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#3229-multi-perspective-issuance-corroboration).) To corroborate the Primary Network Perspective, a remote Network Perspective's CAA check response must be interpreted as permission to issue, regardless of whether the responses from both Perspectives are byte-for-byte identical. Additionally, IdenTrust may consider the response from a remote Network Perspective as corroborating if one or both of the Perspectives experience an acceptable CAA record lookup failure, as defined in this section.

When processing CAA records, IdenTrust process the issue, issue wild, and iodef property tags as specified in RFC 8659, although it is not required to act on the contents of the iodef property tag. Additional property tags may be supported but must not conflict with or supersede the mandatory property tags set out in this document. IdenTrust respects the critical flag and does not issue a Certificate if it encounters an unrecognized property tag with this flag set.

If Certificate Issuance takes place, it is done within the "TTL" field of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater. This stipulation does not prevent IdenTrust from checking CAA records at any other time.

IdenTrust does not rely on any CAA record exception unless it is one of the following:

-   CAA checking is optional for Certificates for which a Certificate Transparency Precertificate was created and logged in at least two public logs, and for which CAA was checked at time of Precertificate Issuance.

-   CAA checking is optional for Certificates issued by a Technically Constrained Subordinate CA Certificate where the lack of CAA checking is an explicit contractual provision in the contract with the Applicant.

IdenTrust is permitted to treat a record lookup failure as permission to issue if:

-   the failure is outside the IdenTrust's infrastructure; and

-   the lookup has been retried at least once; and

-   the domain's zone does not have a DNSSEC validation chain to the ICANN root.

IdenTrust documents potential Issuances that were prevented by a CAA record in sufficient detail to provide feedback to the CA/Browser Forum on the circumstances and should dispatch reports of such Issuance requests to the contact(s) stipulated in the CAA iodef record(s), if present. CAs are not expected to support URL schemes in the iodef record other than mailto: or https:.

In case of failed CAA checking, the rejection transaction record will include:

-   The FQDN(s) requested;

-   Whether or not "identrust.com" or "[www.identrust.com](http://www.identrust.com)" were listed as one the trusted CA Domain Names in the CAA record; and

-   Whether or not the Domain Name was on the denied or high-risk request lists.

For Enterprise RAs issuing server Certificates, this record will include the following information in their rejection records:

-   Applicant/PKI Sponsor's name as it appears in the Applicant/PKI Sponsor's request for a Certificate;

-   Method of application (e.g., online, in-person, remote) for each data element accepted for proofing, including electronic forms;

-   Source of verification (i.e., which databases used for cross-checks);

-   Method of verification (e.g., online, in-person, remote);

-   Date/time of verification;

-   Fields that failed verification;

-   All Identity Proofing data;

-   Whether or not "identrust.com" or "[www.identrust.com](http://www.identrust.com)" were listed as one the trusted CA Domain Names in the CAA record; and

-   Date/time of process completion.

#### Verification Against High Risk and Denied Request Lists

To ensure that requests for TrustID Certificates are properly verified, IdenTrust and RAs conduct 2 additional checks when necessary:

1.  IdenTrust and RAs maintain internal lists of prior denied applications identified as posing a risk; and

2.  IdenTrust and RAs will check high-risk domain requests against an authoritative third party list before Issuance.

Information returned from such checks is used during the application process by an LRA within IdenTrust or an RA when identifying potentially illegitimate Certificate Requests. If an RA is elected to perform verification processes, IdenTrust will verify that the RA's processes used to identify high-risk domain requests and prior denied requests provide a level of assurance that is equal to or exceeds the same level of assurance provided by the process described below.

-   For OV Server Certificates, additional requirements as specified in [Section 4.2.1 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#421-performing-identification-and-authentication-functions); and

-   For EV Server Certificates, additional requirements as specified in [Section 3.2.2.12 of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32212-other-verification-requirements).

#### High Risk Request Procedure

To prevent potential phishing, fraudulent use and to take further precautions against potential compromise, IdenTrust, and the RA maintains a list of prior high-risk requests and checks a third party authority list specifying current high-risk Domain Names. This list is used by LRAs to identify potential risks.

Should an LRA identify an application with any potential risk posed to IdenTrust or a Domain Name listed on the third party authority list, it will be flagged and brought to the attention of management to complete further internal verification. To prevent high-risk Issuance of a TrustID Certificate this internal verification will require one or more the following pieces of evidence:

-   A Call to the Sponsoring Organization;

-   Request further documentation from the Sponsoring Organization;

-   Careful examination of the FQDN to confirm whether the intent of the Domain Registrant is to imitate or mislead customers of an FQDN on the high risk third party authority list to commit fraudulent or phishing activities (e.g., www.g00gle.com, www.1dentrust.com, etc.) and specific filters that are established at the System level to deny initial applications (e.g., non-US ASCII characters);

-   Manual review of all documents and information provided; and/or

-   Other verifiable proof as deemed necessary by RA or IdenTrust management.

#### Denied Request Procedure

TrustID Certificate applications that cannot pass this review will not be issued a TrustID Certificate. If the Certificate does not pass review, it will be added to a list of previously denied applications and kept for verification purposes of future TrustID Certificate applications.

### Approval or Rejection of Certificate Applications

CAs shall not Issue Certificates containing Internal Names or Reserved IP Addresses, as such names cannot be validated according to [Section 3.2.2.4](#validation-of-domain-authorization-or-control)Â or [Section 3.2.2.5](#authentication-for-an-ip-address). IdenTrust and RAs approve an Applicant/PKI Sponsor Certificate application if the Identity Proofing processes described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation) and [Section 3.3](#identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests) are completed successfully.

IdenTrust does not Issue Certificates for Reserved IP Addresses, or internal server names and will not issue them for the gTLD domains not approved on these grounds.

#### Final Cross-Correlation and Due Diligence

Enterprise RAs may perform the cross-correlation and due diligence for EV Server Certificates following the requirements ofÂ [Section 3.2.2.13Â of the EV TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/extended-validation/guidelines/#32213-final-cross-correlation-and-due-diligence).

### Time to Process Certificate Applications

For server Certificates, where the CAA record is found and it lists an explicit Issuing CA name or CA Domain Name, as the Issuing CA, the Issuance must be done within the time specified in the "TTL" field of the CAA record, or 8 hours, whichever is greater.

## Certificate Issuance

### CA Actions During Certificate Issuance

#### Manual Authorization of Certificate Issuance for Root CAs

Certificate Issuance by the Root CA shall require an Individual authorized by the CA (i.e., the CA System operator, system officer, or PKI administrator) to deliberately issue a direct command in order for the Root CA to perform a Certificate signing operation.

#### Linting of To-Be-Signed Certificate Content

IdenTrust has a technical control to verify that the to-be-signed Certificate corresponds to the to-be-signed Precertificate in the manner described in Section 3.2 of RFC 6962.

Methods used to produce a Certificate containing the to-be-signed Certificate content include, but are not limited to:

1.  Sign theÂ tbsCertificateÂ with a "dummy" Private Key whose Public Key component is not certified by a Certificate that chains to a Publicly-Trusted CA Certificate; or

2.  Specify a static value for theÂ signatureÂ field of the Certificate ASN.1 SEQUENCE.

IdenTrust may implement its own Certificate Linting tools, but IdenTrust will use the Linting tools that have been widely adopted by the industry (see <https://cabforum.org/resources/tools/>).

#### Linting of Issued Certificates

IdenTrust may use a Linting process to test each issued Certificate.

#### Issuance Via Secure Website for Server Certificates

For each Certificate Issuance to an Applicant/PKI Sponsor or Subscriber, the following occurs during the same server-authenticated SSL/TLS session:

1.  The Applicant/PKI Sponsor/Subscriber initiates the Certificate retrieval by accessing via a browser a URL (retrieval URL) provided by IdenTrust or the RA. In the resulting web session, the IdenTrust CA or RA System authenticates itself to the Subscriber and encrypts all communication utilizing a server-authenticated SSL/TLS encrypted channel verifiable by a Certificate issued by a distinct IdenTrust Certificate Authority natively trusted in browsers.

2.  The Applicant/PKI Sponsor /Subscriber authenticates himself or herself to the web server used in the retrieval process by supplying the Activation Code delivered by IdenTrust or the RA together with the Account Password selected by the Applicant/ PKI Sponsor /Subscriber during the application process described in [Section 4.1](#certificate-application). This 2-factor authentication is required for all Certificate retrievals by an Applicant/PKI Sponsor /Subscriber from IdenTrust.

The PKI Sponsor generates the Key Pair for the Electronic Device and submits the PKCS#10 Certificate Request as an initial step during registration. The process will also verify the Public Key of an Electronic Device that is requested has less than 2048-bit encryption and if it uses a known weak Private Key. If either or both are automatically detected in the secure session, the PKI Sponsor will be required to correct the determined issue before the server Certificate can be issued.

The Certificate Issuance process described in this section will ensure compliance with this CP-CPS:

1.  IdenTrust has verified the source of the Certificate Request.

2.  IdenTrust has confirmed the authenticity and authority of the source of information contained within the Subscriber's Certificates.

3.  IdenTrust has built and signed the Subscriber's Certificates in a secure manner.

4.  IdenTrust has delivered the Subscriber's Certificates, the necessary Subordinate CA, and Root CA Certificates to the Subscriber.

5.  IdenTrust has published the Subscriber\'s Certificates to IdenTrust\'s Repository.

Upon Issuance of a TrustID Certificate, IdenTrust warrants to all Program Participants that:

1.  Upon receiving a request for a Certificate, IdenTrust has managed the TrustID Certificate in accordance with these requirements;

2.  IdenTrust has complied with all requirements in the TrustID CP-CPS when identifying the Subscriber and issuing the TrustID Certificate;

3.  There are no misrepresentations of fact in the TrustID Certificate known to IdenTrust and IdenTrust has verified the information in the TrustID Certificate in accordance with [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation);

4.  Information provided by the Subscriber for inclusion in the TrustID Certificate has been accurately transcribed to the TrustID Certificate; and

5.  The TrustID Certificate meets the material requirements of this TrustID CP-CPS.

For server Certificates, the Issuance of a Certificate verifies:

1.  The PKI Sponsor has the right to use the Domain Name(s) at the time of application and Identity Proofing;

2.  The PKI Sponsor was authorized to obtain that Certificate from the Domain Name administrator at the time of application and Identity Proofing;

3.  The information included on the Certificate is accurate at the time of application and Identity Proofing;

4.  The information included on the Certificate is not misleading;

5.  The identity of the PKI Sponsor has been verified according to these Identity Proofing processes described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation);

6.  The PKI Sponsor has signed and is bound by the Subscriber Agreement;

7.  IdenTrust will maintain a publicly accessible Repository for verification of the status of the server Certificate; and

8.  IdenTrust will revoke the server Certificate for any of the reasons listed in [Section 4.9.1.1](#reasons-for-revoking-subscriber-certificates).

These warranties are articulated in the Subscriber Agreement provided to the Applicant/PKI Sponsor/Subscriber during the registration process.

Alternative methods for the Issuance of Certificates are not implemented at this time.

### Notification to Subscriber by the CA of Issuance of Certificate

If Certificates are delivered to the Subscriber during an in-person session, no notification is required. Otherwise, Certificate retrieval links are sent to the Email Address provided by the Subscriber during the Certificate Application process.

## Certificate Acceptance

### Conduct Constituting Certificate Acceptance

Upon Issuance and installation of the TrustID Certificate, Subscribers are provided with the contents of the Certificate in a human-readable form for their review. IdenTrust requires the Subscriber to review the Certificate and affirmatively communicate Acceptance of its content at the end of the retrieval process. IdenTrust records the act of the Acceptance of the TrustID Certificate in accordance with [Section 5.5.1](#types-of-records-archived).

By accepting a TrustID Certificate, the Subscriber warrants that all of the information provided by the Applicant/PKI Sponsor (and by its Sponsoring Organization, where applicable) and included in the TrustID Certificate, and all representations made by the Subscriber (and by its Sponsoring Organization, where applicable) as part of the application and Identity Proofing process, are true and not misleading.

### Publication of the Certificate by the CA

Pursuant to [Section 2.2.1](#repositories-1), IdenTrust TrustID Certificates are published in the Repository upon Issuance. The Repository is publicly available.

### Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

Notification of Certificate Issuance to others is effectuated by the publication of the TrustID Certificate in a recognized Repository..

## Key Pair and Certificate Usage

### Subscriber Private Key and Certificate Usage

Subscribers who receive Certificates from IdenTrust assert that they will comply with the TLS BR as well as those in this CP-CPS by either signing the Subscriber Agreement online or in paper copy; or, by undergoing a full registration process before receiving the Certificate. Additional information concerning the rights and obligations of Subscribers may be found in [Section 9.6.3](#subscriber-representations-and-warranties).

Key Usage is discussed in [Section 6.1.7](#key-usage-purposes-as-per-x509-v3-key-usage-field).

### Relying Party Public Key and Certificate Usage

Relying Parties must evaluate the environment and the associated threats and vulnerabilities and determine the level of risk they are willing to accept based on the sensitivity or significance of the information. This evaluation is done by each Relying Party for each application and is not controlled by the TrustID CP or this CPS. Relying Parties who rely on stale CRLs do so at their own risk. See [Section 4.8.7](#notification-of-certificate-issuance-by-the-ca-to-other-entities-3).

Parties who rely upon the Certificates issued under the TrustID CP or this CPS should preserve original signed data, the applications necessary to read and process that data, and the cryptographic applications needed to verify the Digital Signatures on that data for as long as it may be necessary to verify the signature on that data.

## Certificate Renewal

### Circumstance for Certificate Renewal

A Certificate may be renewed if the Key Pair has not reached the end of its validity, the Private Key has not been compromised, and the End Entity name and attributes are correct. Thus, IdenTrust may choose to implement a 3-year re-key period re-key period with an initial issuance and 2 annual renewals before re-key is required. The old Certificate need not be revoked, but must not be further re-keyed, renewed, or updated.

### Who May Request Renewal

Only the End Entity may request Certificate renewal.

### Processing Certificate Renewal Requests

Renewal of a TrustID Certificate for an Affiliated Individual requires that the affiliation between the individual and their Sponsoring Organization is still valid at the time of renewal.

### Notification of New Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

The notification procedures used by the IdenTrust or RA's are the same as with a new End Entity request.

### Conduct Constituting Acceptance of a Renewal Certificate

Upon renewal and installation of the Certificate, Subscribers are to be provided with the contents of the Certificate in a human-readable form for their review. The Issuing CA should require that the Subscriber review the Certificate and affirmatively communicate Acceptance of its content at the end of the retrieval process. The Issuing CA records the act of the Acceptance of the TrustID Certificate in accordance with [Section 5.5.1](#types-of-records-archived).

### Publication of the Renewal Certificate by the CA

The Issuing CA's Certificates are to be published in a publicly available Repository.

### Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

No other entities are notified of Certificate Issuance by the CA.

## Certificate Re-Key

Re-keying a Certificate consists of creating a new Certificate with a different Public Key (and serial number) while retaining the remaining content of the old Certificate that describes the Subject and assigning a new Validity Period to such Certificate. The new Certificate may be assigned different Key identifiers, specify a different CRL distribution point, and/or be signed with a different Key.

When IdenTrust updates the Key Pairs and Certificates for the Root CA Certificates are made available publicly via the Repository, which is disclosed in the End Entity and Subordinate CA Certificates themselves.

The subject name in a Certificate that has been re-keyed does not change and the old Certificate need not be revoked since it does not violate the requirement for name uniqueness.

In addition, after Certificate re-key, the old Certificate is not revoked by IdenTrust, and the Subscriber may or may not revoke it. In any case, the System automatically prevents the Certificate to be re-keyed again, renewed, or modified.

### Circumstance for Certificate Re-Key

Subscribers should plan on re-keying well in advance of the time when the period of validity of a Key Pair or Certificate described in [Section 6.3.2](#certificate-operational-periods-and-key-pair-usage-periods) is scheduled to expire. Certificates will be re-keyed to the same period of validity as the original Certificate. Creating a new Key Pair and obtaining a new Certificate prevents a disruption in signing activities that would be caused if the Certificate were allowed to expire before attempting to re-key.

### Who May Request Certification of a New Public Key

The original Subscribers are also entitled to request its re-key (See [Section 3.3](#identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests) and [Section 3.3.1](#identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests)).

### Processing Certificate Re-Keying Requests

For server Certificates, 30 days before the expiration period, the IdenTrust or the RA's system may automatically notify the Subscriber that he or she must request a Re-key and re-establish identity by presenting his or her valid TrustID Certificate.

IdenTrust will authenticate the Subscriber by using the Identity Proofing processes required for the corresponding Certificate in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation). Once the Subscriber is authenticated, IdenTrust will then follow the TrustID Certificate Issuance process described in [Section 4.4](#certificate-acceptance).

### Notification of New Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

See [Section 4.3.2](#notification-to-subscriber-by-the-ca-of-issuance-of-certificate).

### Conduct Constituting Acceptance of a Re-Keyed Certificate

See [Section 4.4.1](#conduct-constituting-certificate-acceptance)

### Publication of the Re-Keyed Certificate by the CA

See [Section 4.4.2](#publication-of-the-certificate-by-the-ca).

### Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

See [Section 4.3.3](#notification-of-certificate-issuance-by-the-ca-to-other-entities-3).

## Certificate Modification

### Circumstance for Certificate Modification

IdenTrust allows the modification of only Valid Certificates (i.e., Certificate is neither revoked nor expired). The new Certificate, with a new Key Pair, is issued with the same expiration date as the original Certificate.

In the case of Certificate replacement IdenTrust allows the replacement of Certificates when the Subscriber's Private Key has not been compromised and there are no changes to the Certificate. Note that in the case where a non-escrowed Private Key is lost or damaged, the Certificate cannot be replaced or recovered and the identity of the Subscriber must be established through the initial registration process described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation).

For server Certificate modification, PKI Sponsors may submit modification requests for adding, removing, and modifying the contents of the SAN including the FQDN(s). These types of additions that have not been verified will need to be established through the initial registration process described in [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation) to complete the modification.

A Root and Subordinate CAs Certificates may be modified if approved in writing by the IdenTrust PMA.

### Who May Request Certificate Modification

Subscribers with Valid Certificates are entitled to request email modification and replacements. See [Section 3.2.3](#authentication-of-individual-identity) and [Section 4.1.1](#who-can-submit-a-certificate-application) for specific details.

IdenTrust may request a modification of its Root and Subordinate CA Certificates.

### Processing Certificate Modification Requests

Upon receiving an authenticated request to replace a damaged or lost Certificate from a or an authorized official of a business entity for a business representative Subscriber, IdenTrust replaces the Certificate and records the following Certificate replacement transaction data:

1.  Certificate serial number;

2.  Certificate common name;

3.  Subject Alternative name;

4.  Certificate Policy OID;

5.  Date/time of completion of replacement process; and

6.  All associated replacement data.

Modification of a Root CA Certificate or Subordinate CA Certificate requires that a request be made in writing to the IdenTrust PMA, to address interoperability concerns. Proposals to modify CA Certificates are processed as follows:

A survey of the applications deployed in the PKI and an analysis of whether the proposed modification creates interoperability concerns are performed. Any concerns raised by any PMA member or other designated relevant third party should be addressed by the IdenTrust Operations group. When there are no remaining concerns, the Root or Subordinate CA Certificate with the requested modifications is issued. The old CA Certificate will not be revoked unless all issues related to the transition from the old CA Certificate to the new CA Certificate have been resolved.

### Notification of New Certificate Issuance to Subscriber

See [Section 4.3.2](#notification-to-subscriber-by-the-ca-of-issuance-of-certificate).

### Conduct Constituting Acceptance of a Modified Certificate

See [Section 4.4.1](#conduct-constituting-certificate-acceptance)

### Publication of the Modified Certificate by the CA

See [Section 4.4.2](#publication-of-the-certificate-by-the-ca).

### Notification of Certificate Issuance by the CA to Other Entities

See [Section 4.6.7](#notification-of-certificate-issuance-by-the-ca-to-other-entities-1).

## Certificate Revocation and Suspension

### Circumstances for Revocation

#### Reasons for Revoking Subscriber Certificates

[]{#_Reasons_for_Revoking .anchor}The CA may support Revocation of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates.

With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, IdenTrust will revoke a Subscriber Certificate individually or via MRE within 24 hours and use the corresponding CRLReason ([See Section 7.2.2](#crl-and-crl-entry-extensions)) if one or more of the following occurs:

1.  The Subscriber requests in writing, without specifying a CRLReason, that IdenTrust revoke the Certificate (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);

2.  The Subscriber notifies IdenTrust that the original Certificate Request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

3.  IdenTrust obtains evidence that the Subscriber's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key Compromise (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);

4.  IdenTrust is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that can easily compute the Subscriber's Private Key based on the Public Key in the Certificate, including but not limited to those identified in [Section 6.1.1.3](#_Subscriber_Key_Pair) (5) (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise);

5.  IdenTrust obtains evidence that the validation of domain authorization or control for any Fully Qualified Domain Name or IP Address in the Certificate should not be relied upon (CRLReason #4, superseded).

With the exception of Short-lived Subscriber Certificates, IdenTrust should revoke a Subscriber Certificate within 24 hours and must revoke a Subscriber Certificate within 5 days and use the corresponding CRLReason ([See Section 7.2.2](#crl-and-crl-entry-extensions)) if one or more of the following occurs:

6.  The Certificate no longer complies with the requirements in the relevant section of the TLS BR (CRLReason #4, superseded);

7.  IdenTrust obtains evidence that the Certificate was misused (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

8.  IdenTrust is made aware that a Subscriber has violated one or more of its material obligations under the Subscriber Agreement or Terms of Use (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

9.  IdenTrust is made aware of any circumstance indicating that use of a FQDN or IP Address in the Certificate is no longer legally permitted (e.g. a court or arbitrator has revoked a Domain Name Registrant's right to use the Domain Name, a relevant licensing or services agreement between the Domain Name Registrant and the Applicant has terminated, or the Domain Name Registrant has failed to renew the Domain Name) (CRLReason #5, CessationOfOperation);

10. IdenTrust is made aware that a Wildcard Certificate has been used to authenticate a fraudulently misleading subordinate Fully Qualified Domain Name (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

11. IdenTrust is made aware of a material change in the information contained in the Certificate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

12. IdenTrust is made aware that the Certificate was not issued in accordance with the TLS BR or the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement (CRLReason #4, superseded);

13. IdenTrust determines or is made aware that any of the information appearing in the Certificate is inaccurate (CRLReason #9, privilegeWithdrawn);

14. IdenTrust\'s right to Issue Certificates under the TLS BR expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL);

15. Revocation is required by IdenTrust's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practices Statement (CRLReason "unspecified (0)" which results in no reasonCode extension being provided in the CRL); or

16. IdenTrust is made aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Subscriber's Private Key to compromise or if there is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed (CRLReason #1, keyCompromise).

#### Reasons for Revoking a Subordinate CA Certificate

IdenTrust will revoke a Subordinate CA Certificate within 7 days if one or more of the following occurs:

1.  The Subordinate CA requests Revocation in writing;

2.  The Subordinate CA notifies IdenTrust that the original Certificate Request was not authorized and does not retroactively grant authorization;

3.  IdenTrust obtains evidence that the Subordinate CA's Private Key corresponding to the Public Key in the Certificate suffered a Key compromise or no longer complies with the requirements of [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes) and [Section 6.1.6](#public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);

4.  IdenTrust obtains evidence that the CA Certificate was misused;

5.  IdenTrust confirms that the CA Certificate was not issued in accordance with or that Subordinate CA has not complied with this document or the applicable Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement;

6.  IdenTrust determines that any of the information appearing in the CA Certificate is inaccurate or misleading;

7.  IdenTrust or the Subordinate CA ceases operations for any reason and has not arranged for another CA to provide Revocation support for the CA Certificate;

8.  IdenTrust or the Subordinate CA's right to Issue Certificates under the TLS BR expires or is revoked or terminated, unless the Issuing CA has made arrangements to continue maintaining the CRL/OCSP Repository;

9.  Revocation is required by IdenTrust's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement; or

10. The technical content or format of the CA Certificate presents an unacceptable risk to Application Software Suppliers or Relying Parties.

### Who Can Request Revocation

Different parties may request Certificate Revocation as follows:

-   The Issuing CA may summarily revoke Certificates within its domain.

-   An RA can request the Revocation of an End Entity's TrustID Certificate on behalf of the End Entity, the Sponsoring Organization, or other authorized party, or on its behalf.

-   An End Entity is authorized to request the Revocation of his, her, or its Certificate, as is a Subscriber's Sponsoring Organization.

-   Additionally, Subscribers, Authorized Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the Issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the Certificate. Other third parties may submit Certificate Problem Reports informing the Issuing CA of reasonable cause to revoke the Certificate. See [Section 4.9.1.1](#reasons-for-revoking-subscriber-certificates).

> In any case, notice should be provided to the Subscriber promptly after Revocation.

### Procedure for Revocation Request

The CA shall provide a process for Subscribers to request Revocation of their own Certificates. The process must be described in the CA's Certificate Policy or Certification Practice Statement. The CA shall maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to Accept and respond to Revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

The CA shall provide Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with clear instructions for reporting suspected Private Key Compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to Certificates. The CA shall publicly disclose the instructions through a readily accessible online means and in Section 1.5.2 of their CP-CPS.

IdenTrust shall provide a process for Subscribers to request Revocation of their own Certificates.

IdenTrust maintains a continuous 24x7 ability to Accept and respond to Revocation requests and Certificate Problem Reports.

When the Private Key of a Subscriber's Certificate to be revoked is available, it may be revoked by sending Revocation that has a Digital Signature to the LRA, Trusted Agent, or Enterprise RA, establishing a Client-authenticated SSL/TLS encrypted session with the RA or CA System.

If the Private Key is not available, Revocation can be accomplished by contacting an LRA, Enterprise RA, or a Trusted Agent and undergoing an Identity Proofing process based on the procedures outlined in [Section 3.2.3](#authentication-of-individual-identity). In this case, a request for Certificate suspension can be submitted while a complete Identity Proofing process is performed. The Certificate remains suspended until further verification is completed and the request resolves into a Revocation or unsuspension if not a Subscriber Certificate.

The Subscriber or PKI Sponsor should first attempt to contact the LRA, Enterprise RA, or Trusted Agent who was involved during the Issuance of the Certificate or the Trusted Agent of their Sponsoring Organization. LRAs and Enterprise RAs can revoke the Certificate upon completion of positive Identity Proofing.

Trusted agents must complete another process to complete the Revocation. After positive Identity Proofing has been performed and when a Trusted Agent intermediates a Revocation request, the LRA will authenticate Trusted Agent's signed Revocation request emails by verifying (i) the Trusted Agent has a Valid Certificate of commensurate of the Certificate to be revoked and (ii) the authority to request actions on behalf to the Sponsoring Organization. The authority to request is validated based on lists put together by LRAs based on the paperwork that nominates the Trusted Agent. The list contains identifiers that uniquely identify the Trusted Agent (i.e., Name, Certificate's thumbprint/fingerprint / serial number).

See [Section 1.5.2](#contact-person) for guidelines on reporting Certificate issues that may require Revocation.

The Subscriber or the PKI Sponsor is required to indicate the reason for the Revocation request as listed on [Section 7.2.2](#crl-and-crl-entry-extensions) - CRL and CRL Entry Extensions.

The Subscriber or PKI Sponsor is required to present an acceptable form(s) of photo identification (See [Section 3.2.3.1](#validation-of-individual-identity-acceptable-forms-of-identification-documents)), which the LRA, Enterprise RA, or Trusted Agent reviews to identify and authenticate the Subscriber or PKI Sponsor making the Revocation request. Trusted Agents notify LRAs immediately upon validating the Revocation request and request that the LRA revoke the Certificate.

If the Cryptographic Module cannot be obtained from the Subscriber, then the Subscriber's Certificate(s) will be immediately revoked, expressing the reason code as "Key compromise." Promptly after Revocation, IdenTrust updates the Certificate status in the Repository and updates the CRL. Alternatively, a Sponsoring Organization may opt for not collecting any Cryptographic Module due to logistical difficulties (e.g., Subscriber is terminated under unfriendly conditions, Subscriber in a remote location, etc.) and instead always request Revocation of the Certificates as if the Cryptographic Module were not obtained from the Subscriber. In these cases, the Revocation request will always result in a "Key compromise" code.

#### Procedure for Mass Revocation Events

Starting on September 1, 2025, IdenTrust will have in place an MRE plan available to Enterprise Customers to handle automated Mass Revocations of TLS Certificates in case of Revocation request(s) due to:

-   Compromise or suspected compromised of a CA Private Key

-   Compliance failures affecting a significant number of Certificates

-   Discovery of a major vulnerabilityÂ impacting server Private Keys.

### Revocation Request Grace Period

No stipulation.

### Time Within Which CA Must Process the Revocation Request

IdenTrust maintains a continuous 24x7 ability to communicate with Anti-Malware Organizations, Application Software Suppliers, and law enforcement agencies and respond to high-priority Certificate Problem Reports, such as reports requesting Revocation of Certificates used to sign malicious code, fraud, or other illegal conduct.

IdenTrust acknowledge receipt of plausible notices about Key Compromise signed with a Certificate issued IdenTrust or by an IdenTrust Subordinate CA.

Within 24 hours after receiving a Certificate Problem Report, IdenTrust will investigate the facts and circumstances related to a Certificate Problem Report and provide a preliminary report on its findings to both the Subscriber and the entity who filed the Certificate Problem Report.

After reviewing the facts and circumstances, IdenTrust will work with the Subscriber and any entity reporting the Certificate Problem Report or other Revocation-related notice to establish whether or not the Certificate will be revoked, and if so, a date on which IdenTrust will revoke the Certificate. The period from receipt of the Certificate Problem Report or Revocation-related notice to published Revocation must not exceed the time frame set forth inÂ [[Section 4.9.1.1](#reasons-for-revoking-subscriber-certificates)](#_Reasons_for_Revoking). The date selected by IdenTrust should consider the following criteria:

1.  The nature of the alleged problem (scope, context, severity, magnitude, risk of harm, adware, spyware, malware, software bug, etc.);

2.  The consequences of Revocation (direct and collateral impacts to Subscribers and Relying Parties);

3.  The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;

4.  The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official should be addressed with higher priority); and

5.  The relevant legislation.

### Revocation Checking Requirements for Relying Parties

The use of revoked Certificates could have damaging or catastrophic consequences in certain applications. The matter of how often new Revocation data should be obtained is a determination to be made by the Relying Party, considering the risk, responsibility, and consequences for using a Certificate whose Revocation status cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, before relying on a TrustID Certificate an Authorized Relying Party must conduct a validation request in accordance with the method and procedures established by the Issuing CA pursuant to [Section 4.10](#certificate-status-services). If it is temporarily infeasible to obtain Revocation information, then the Relying Party must either reject use of the Certificate, or make an informed decision to Accept the risk, responsibility, and consequences for using a Certificate whose authenticity cannot be guaranteed to the standards of this CP-CPS.

### CRL Issuance Frequency

CRLs must be available via a publicly-accessible HTTP URL (i.e., "published").

IdenTrust CRLs are available via this publicly-accessible HTTP URL: <http://crl.dentrust.com>.

Within twenty-four (24) hours of issuing its first Certificate, the Issuing CA generate and publish either: - a full and complete CRL; OR - partitioned (i.e., "sharded") CRLs that, when aggregated, represent the equivalent of a full and complete CRL.

IdenTrust CAs issuing Subscriber Certificates:

1.  Update and publish a new CRL at least every: - seven (7) days if all Certificates include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod ("AIA OCSP pointer"); or - four (4) days in all other cases;

2.  Update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours after recording a Certificate as revoked.

IdenTrust CAs Issuing CA Certificates:

1.  Update and publish a new CRL at least every twelve (12) months;

2.  Update and publish a new CRL within twenty-four (24) hours after recording a Certificate as revoked.

The IdenTrust Issuing CA will continue issuing CRLs until one of the following is true:

-   all Subordinate CA Certificates containing the same Subject Public Key are expired; or

-   the corresponding Subordinate CA Private Key is destroyed.

### Maximum Latency for CRLs

No stipulation.

### Online Revocation/Status Checking Availability

When provided, OCSP responses SHALL conform toÂ [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960)Â and/orÂ [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019).

The IdenTrust Certificate Status Authority (CSA) supports OCSP and provides online Certificate status information in Digitally Signed OCSP responses in accordance with RFC 6960 for Certificates issued by Root CAs and Subordinate CAs that are indicated in OCSP Requests submitted by Relying Parties.

The validity interval of an OCSP response is the difference in time between the thisUpdate and nextUpdate field, inclusive. For purposes of computing differences, a difference of 3,600 seconds shall be equal to one hour, and a difference of 86,400 seconds shall be equal to one day, ignoring leap-seconds.

A Certificate serial is "assigned" if:

-   a Certificate or Precertificate with that serial number has been issued by the Issuing CA; or

-   a Precertificate with that serial number has been issued by a Precertificate Signing Certificate, as defined in [Section 7.1.2.4](#X3a11ccc0762fa70b64286ca02bf471eb0cdabb5), associated with the Issuing CA.

A Certificate serial is "unassigned" if it is not "assigned."

The following shall apply for communicating the status of Certificates and Precertificates which include an Authority Information Access extension with an id-ad-ocsp accessMethod.

OCSP Responders operated by IdenTrust support the HTTP GET Method, as described in RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019. IdenTrust may process the Nonce extension (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2) in accordance with RFC 8954.

For the status of a Subscriber Certificate or its corresponding Precertificate:

-   An authoritative OCSP response must be available (i.e.,Â the responder must not respond with the "unknown" status) starting no more than 15 minutes after the Certificate or Precertificate is first published or otherwise made available.

-   For OCSP responses with validity intervals less than sixteen hours, the IdenTrust shall provide an updated OCSP response prior to one-half of the Validity Period before the nextUpdate.

-   For OCSP responses with validity intervals greater than or equal to sixteen hours, IdenTrust shall provide an updated OCSP response at least eight hours prior to the nextUpdate, and no later than four days after the thisUpdate.

For the status of a Subordinate CA Certificate, IdenTrust shall provide an updated OCSP response at least every twelve months, and within 24 hours after revoking the Certificate.

The following shall apply for communicating the status of all Certificates for which an OCSP Responder is willing or required to respond.

OCSP responses must conform to RFC 6960 and/or RFC 5019. OCSP responses must either:

1.  be signed by the IdenTrust CA that issued the Certificates whose Revocation status is being checked, or

2.  be signed by an OCSP Responder which complies with the OCSP Responder Certificate Profile in [Section 7.1.2.8 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#7128-ocsp-responder-certificate-profile).

OCSP responses for Subscriber Certificates must have a validity interval greater than or equal to eight hours and less than or equal to ten days.

If the OCSP Responder receives a request for the status of a Certificate serial number that is "unassigned," then the responder should not respond with a "good" status. If the OCSP Responder is for a CA that is not Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.2.3 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#7123-technically-constrained-non-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile) or [Section 7.1.2.5 of the TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#7125-technically-constrained-tls-subordinate-ca-certificate-profile), the responder must not respond with a "good" status for request.

### Online Revocation Checking Requirements

OCSP Responders operated by the IdenTrust shall support the HTTP GET method, as described inÂ [RFC 6960](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6960)Â and/orÂ [RFC 5019](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5019)

### Other Forms of Revocation Advertisements Available

Upon explicit request, IdenTrust supports other methods for obtaining Certificate status information than those described in [Section 4.8.7](#notification-of-certificate-issuance-by-the-ca-to-other-entities-3) and [Section 4.8.9](#online-revocationstatus-checking-availability) in cases of (i) IdenTrust misâissued the Certificate, (ii) or (ii) there is a suspected or actual compromise of the Applicant's or CA's Private Key. IdenTrust reserves the right to make other forms of Revocation advertisement available to Relying Parties.

### Special Requirements for Re-Key Compromise

See [Section 4.9.1](#circumstances-for-revocation) Circumstances for Revocation.

Reports of Key Compromise to IdenTrust must include proof of Key Compromise in one of the following formats:

1.  A Certificate signed request (CSR) with the CN "Proof of Key Compromise for IdenTrust," signed by the compromised Private Key, or

2.  The compromised Private Key itself

Practices followed in the case of a CA Private Key compromised are explained in [Section 5.7.3](#entity-private-key-compromise-procedures) Practices followed in the case of a Subscriber's Private Key compromised are explained in [Section 4.9.3](#procedure-for-revocation-request).

### Circumstances for Suspension

The Repository must not include entries that indicate that a Certificate is suspended; IdenTrust does not include suspended Certificates in the Repository.

### Procedure for Suspension Request

No stipulation.

### Limits on Suspension Period

No stipulation.

### 4.9.16 Limits on Suspension Period 

No stipulation.

## Certificate Status Services

### Operational Characteristics

Revocation entries on the CRL or OCSP Response are removed until after the expiry date of a revoked Certificate.

### Service Availability

The CA shall operate and maintain its CRL and optional OCSP capability with resources sufficient to provide a response time of ten seconds or less under normal operating conditions.

The CA shall maintain an online 24x7 Repository that application software can use to automatically check the current status of all unexpired Certificates issued by the CA.

The CA shall maintain a continuous 24x7 ability to respond internally to a high-priority Certificate Problem Report, and where appropriate, forward such a complaint to law enforcement authorities, and/or revoke a Certificate that is the subject of such a complaint.

IdenTrust operates and maintains its CRL and optional OCSP capability with resources sufficient to provide a response time of ten (10) seconds or less under normal operating conditions.

Additionally, online Certificate status information is available through IdenTrust's TrustID validation services through OCSP. The validation services can be found at <https://commercial.ocsp.identrust.com>.

#### Certificate Problem Reporting

IdenTrust provides Subscribers, Relying Parties, Application Software Suppliers, and other third parties with contact information for reporting suspected Private Key compromise, Certificate misuse, or other types of fraud, compromise, misuse, inappropriate conduct, or any other matter related to the TrustID Certificates. The contact details are available online at the IdenTrust website in the "OUR HELPFUL SUPPORT TEAM" webpage at: <https://www.identrust.com/support/support-team>.

This page lists a telephone number to contact Customer Support Representatives during business hours and an email contact to ensure reporting will be received 24/7. In this page, use the link at the bottom to [Report Certificate Security Compromise Issues](https://www.identrust.com/report-certificate-security-compromise-issues).

Once a report is received either by email or telephone call, a Customer Support Representative will file a ticket for the report including the details provided by the contact. The Customer Support Representative will provide the following information for the report when possible:

1.  Account number;

2.  Name and contact information of the Individual/Organization reporting the Certificate;

3.  Subscriber, Organization, domain, and/or PKI Sponsor name;

4.  Nature of the issue (illegal activity, Private Key compromise, etc.); and

5.  When the issue was discovered.

Once that ticket is filed, the Customer Support Representative will forward that contact with the details and ticket number to the appropriate level of management or the Security Office via email. Upon creating a record of the contact, the following considerations are assessed to determine the appropriate action:

1.  The nature of the alleged problem;

2.  The number of Certificate Problem Reports received about a particular Certificate or Subscriber;

3.  The entity making the complaint (for example, a complaint from a law enforcement official that a website is engaged in illegal activities should carry more weight than a complaint from a consumer alleging that he/she did not receive the good they ordered); and

4.  Relevant legislation.

Upon review, IdenTrust security, or an appropriate level of management, will determine whether Revocation, suspension, or other action is warranted. If it is determined that Revocation or suspension is necessary, The Security Office or management will send an official request to a Customer Support Representative or an LRA to execute the specified action accordingly. When deemed necessary based on the content of the report and the findings by Security and management, IdenTrust will forward the complaint to law enforcement.

All email contact associated with the case must be saved and documented by the Customer Support agent.

To respond to high-priority Certificate Problem Reports IdenTrust maintains the Certificate Problem Reports support page 24/7 whether by telephone contact during office hours or email contact during the evening, weekend, or holiday hours.

# FACILITY, MANAGEMENT, AND OPERATIONAL CONTROLS

The NetSec BR is incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.

IdenTrust developed, implements and maintains a comprehensive security program designed to:

1.  Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;

2.  Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes;

3.  Protect against unauthorized or unlawful access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;

4.  Protect against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes; and

5.  Comply with all other security requirements applicable to the CA by law.

IdenTrust CA Security Management Process must include an annual Risk Assessment that:

1.  Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;

2.  Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and

3.  Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.

The Certificate Management Process must include:

1.  Physical security and environmental controls;

2.  System integrity controls, including configuration management, integrity maintenance of trusted code, and malware detection/prevention;

3.  Network security and firewall management, including port restrictions and IP Address filtering;

4.  User management, separate trusted-role assignments, education, awareness, and training; and

5.  Logical access controls, activity logging, and inactivity time-outs to provide individual accountability.

Based on the Risk Assessment, IdenTrust develops, implements, and maintain a security plan consisting of security procedures, measures, and products designed to achieve the objectives set forth above and to manage and control the risks identified during the Risk Assessment, commensurate with the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes.

The security plan includes administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes.

The security plan also takes into account then-available technology and the cost of implementing the specific measures and shall implement a reasonable level of security appropriate to the harm that might result from a breach of security and the nature of the data to be protected.

## Physical SECURITY Controls

### Site Location and Construction

The construction and location of the building housing the IdenTrust's CA System have been designed to offer security protection mechanisms consistent with facilities used to house high value, sensitive information.

IdenTrust's CA System is housed in an unmarked secure Datacenter, the perimeter of which is completely enclosed by fencing and access-controlled through a programmable electronic badging system. In addition, the perimeter of the building is secured with continuous surveillance cameras and intrusion sensors monitored 24x7x365. These measures provide high-risk protection. For disaster recovery, a second facility in a geographically diverse location provides similar protections. Physical security controls protecting the certification platform and Cryptographic Modules are described in the remainder of this section and apply to both sites. These physical security controls are intended as protection against intentional damage, theft, loss, and unauthorized use.

### Physical Access

IdenTrust provides physical access controls designed to provide protection against unauthorized access to its TrustID CA System resources.

[]{#_Physical_Access_for .anchor}The building is located on fenced and video surveilled grounds. The Building entryways and passageways are also under continuous recorded video surveillance. The facility is actively monitored 24x7x365 with staff onsite during normal business hours. Dedicated facility staff are responsible for monitoring the facility outside of normal business hours and are available to respond to any issues that may arise.

### Power and Air Conditioning

The facility housing the IdenTrust CA, CSA, RAs, and Repositories equipment is supplied with air conditioning and power that is sufficient to provide a reliable operating environment.

Air conditioning is supplied by similarly redundant and separate Systems so that if one System fails, the building can be switched quickly to the other one.

### Water Exposures

To mitigate the risk of water damage, hosts, Network Equipment, and communications facilities for the CA System are housed on the second floor of the company's Datacenter.

The building that houses the Datacenter has been designed for environmental safety and security. It is constructed to Class-4 seismic standards, exceeding the Class-3 earthquake zone in which it is located. To prevent water damage, the IdenTrust Systems are located on the second floor of the building, which is sited in an area where flooding is virtually nonexistent. The building itself contains subfloor curbing to prevent any water or moisture from affecting computer equipment or cabling. The building is also designed so that no water lines or plumbing fixtures exist directly above or below the Datacenter areas.

For further protection, subfloor sensors alert the building staff if water or high moisture is detected.

### Fire Prevention and Protection

The facility housing the IdenTrust CA, RAs, and Repositories equipment provide fire prevention and protection in accordance with local code. The facility is equipped with advanced fire response equipment including:

-   Fire-resistant and fire-retardant construction materials;

-   Advanced chemical, smoke, and heat-based detection systems;

-   Water-based sprinkler fire suppression in business suites;

-   Inergen fire suppression systems (containing inert gas) in the data processing areas, including the Secure Room;

-   24x7x365 onsite operators with fire control console/panel access;

-   Seismic separation between the Secure Room and office space which also serves as an interstitial gap to thwart fire spread;

-   The building has a full complement of VESDA sensors that automatically alert both building staff and fire authorities if smoke is detected;

-   The Datacenter areas are also equipped with Inergen inert-gas fire suppression systems; and

-   The building has an overcapacity heating/cooling tower, with redundant HVAC systems for backup.

In addition, computer rooms (such as the Secure Room where CA, RAs, and Repositories Systems are housed) are equipped with riot doors, fire doors, and other doors resistant to forcible entry.

### Media Storage

IdenTrust adheres to a "clean desk" Policy under which all hardcopy sensitive information is locked in file cabinets, desks, safes, or other furniture when it is not in use.

Access to storage safes located inside the IdenTrust Secure Room is controlled through Separation of Duties and Multi-Party Control. The safes have dual locks and require 2 Trusted Role employees for access; no Individual has the tools or information necessary to open a safe alone. All access to material inside the safes is documented through access logs. Any material placed into or removed from a safe is logged and signed for by 2 Trusted Role employees.

Server-based computer media containing sensitive materials is stored both within the Secure Room as described in [Section 5.1.2](#physical-access), and at an offsite location, as described below.

The storage vault is a hardened site consisting of a tunnel bored into a solid granite mountain. Environment-related storage mechanisms include but are not limited to constant temperature and humidity, air circulation and filtration, prohibited storage of flammable items, ionization detectors, fire extinguishers, and independent power sources. The entrance is protected by multiple levels of security including gates, mantraps, and a 12,000-pound vault door.

There is only one point of ingress and egress for the facility and for the vault proper. Any attempt to use explosives to force the gates and vault door would be detected by heat detectors and seismic sensors that are connected to an alarm system. Card readers and/or sign-in logs are also utilized for physical access control and auditing.

An armed security force supports the vault. It is also under 24-hour electronic surveillance, and it is regularly patrolled by local law enforcement when not occupied. An armed guard escorts all persons entering the facility and the vault area. All access to the vault requires 24-hour advance notice.

Records are maintained in a temperature and humidity-controlled environment and the vault meets or exceeds all federal requirements for archival storage.

### Waste Disposal

IdenTrust Policy prohibits any media from leaving organizational control that does contain or has contained sensitive data. Such media is destroyed as described below when it reaches end-of-life.

After it is no longer needed, all sensitive information is securely destroyed using procedures that are approved by the Security Office and are consistent with US federal regulations and guidelines. Employees are prohibited from destroying or disposing of potentially important records or information without specific management approval in advance.

All outdated or unnecessary copies of printed sensitive information are disposed of in a secure waste receptacle that is shredded onsite by a bonded company that specializes in disposing of sensitive information, under the direct observation of an IdenTrust Trusted Role employee.

Cryptographic Modules remain in locked safes within the Secure Room; sensitive backup tapes remain in the offsite secure location's vault before destruction. All Cryptographic Modules are zeroized after the Keys on them are no longer needed. If zeroization procedures fail, then they are physically destroyed. Destruction techniques vary depending on the medium in question.

### Off-Site Backup

The TrustID CA System is backed up at the secure facility, using specialized backup software, to a local backup server. These System backups provide the capability to recover from a System failure. Incremental backups are performed daily. Full System backups are performed every week. Incremental and full backups are stored securely offsite: incremental backups are transported electronically to the disaster recovery site, and full backups are sent to the hardened, secure offsite storage vault described in [Section 5.1.6](#media-storage) at least weekly.

## Procedural Controls

### Trusted Roles

A Trusted Role is one whose incumbent performs functions that can introduce security problems if not carried out properly, whether accidentally or maliciously. The people selected to fill Trusted Roles must be careful and above reproach as described in the next section. The functions performed in Trusted Roles form the basis of trust in the entire PKI.

If an authentication control used by a Trusted Role is a username and password, then, where technically feasible, implement the controls outlined in Section 2 of the NetSec BR.

All employees, contractors, and consultants of IdenTrust and RAs who have access to or control over cryptographic operations that may materially affect the Issuance, use, suspension, or Revocation of TrustID Certificates, including access to restricted operations of IdenTrust's CA and RA Systems, and Repository are for purposes of this CP-CPS, considered as serving in Trusted Roles. Such personnel include but are not limited to Administrators, Officers, Auditors, and Operators who oversee CA or RA operations.

IdenTrust follows a documented procedure for appointing Individuals to Trusted Roles. Trusted Role employees who require Certificate System access are issued unique digital credentials -- not user-names and passwords -- to authenticate into the Certificate Systems. All System activities can be traced back to that Individual. No group accounts, shared roles, or shared digital credentials are permitted.

### Number of Persons Required per Task

The Issuing CA will utilize commercially reasonable practices to ensure that one person acting alone cannot circumvent safeguards.

IdenTrust has proper procedural and operational mechanisms in place to ensure that no single Individual may perform sensitive CA activities alone (known as Split-Knowledge Technique). These mechanisms apply principles of separation-of-duties/Multi-Party Control and require the actions of multiple persons to perform such sensitive tasks as:

-   CA Key Generation;

-   CA signing Key activation; and

-   CA Private Key backup.

Physical and logical access controls are invoked to maintain Multi-Party Control over CA and CSA Cryptographic Modules (See [Section 5.1.2](#physical-access) and [Section 6.2.2](#private-key-n-out-of-m-multi-person-control)). Generation, backup, or activation of the Certificate signing Private Keys require the actions of at least 2 Individuals, one of whom is a CA Administrator and the other who may not be a Security Officer.

### Identification and Authentication for Each Role

The vetting of personnel in Trusted Roles is found below in [Section 5.3.1](#qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements) and [Section 5.3.2](#background-check-procedures). Identity Proofing for logical and physical access to CA System resources is described in this section. In accordance with IdenTrust's security policies, IdenTrust's CA personnel must first authenticate themselves before they are:

-   included in the access list for any component of the CA System;

-   included in the access list for physical access to a component of the CA System;

-   issued a Certificate for the performance of their Trusted Role;

-   given an account on a computer connected to the CA System; or

-   otherwise granted physical or logical access to a component of the CA System.

Each of these access methods (Certificates and System accounts) is:

-   directly attributable to the Individual;

-   password/Account Password protected;

-   not shared; and

-   restricted to actions authorized for that role through the use of CA software, operating system, and procedural controls.

If accessed across shared networks, CA operations are secured, using hardware Cryptographic Modules, strong system authentication, and encrypted secure connections.

### Roles Requiring Separation of Duties

IdenTrust maintains strict separation-of-duties/Multi-Party Controls for its Trusted Roles. These controls are audited annually by a third party auditor as part of the AICPA/CICA WebTrust Program for Certification Authorities audit described in [Section 8](#compliance-audit-and-other-assessments).

Oversight of IdenTrust's Trusted Roles is performed by the Risk Management Committee, Operations Management, the human resources department, and Executive Management. IdenTrust maintains a list of Individuals performing each Trusted Role. The list is maintained by the highest-ranking Operations Manager (i.e., Head of IdenTrust or Head of Operations) and, for audit purposes, the Security Office maintains a current copy of the list.

Roles requiring separation of duties include (but are not limited to):

-   **CA/CSA/CMS Administrator:** No person participating as IdenTrust CA/CSA/CMS Administrator will assume the role of Security Officer, LRA, Network Engineer, or Operations Manager.

-   **Local Registration Authority:** An LRA may not assume an Operations Manager, CA/CSA/CMS Administrator, RA Administrator, System Administrator, Network Engineer, Security Officer, or management oversight role (Risk Management, Operations Management, Human Resources, or Executive Management).

-   **RA Administrator** (whether an IdenTrust Internal RA Administrator or an External RA Administrator): An RA Administrator may not assume the Operations Manager, LRA, Network Engineer, or Security Officer role.

-   **System Administrator:** A System Administrator may not assume the Security Officer, LRA or Operations Manager role.

-   **Network Engineer:** The Network Engineer may not assume the Security Officer, LRA, CA/CSA/CMS Administrator, or Operations Manager role.

-   **Security Officer:** The Security Officer may not serve in any other Trusted Role (e.g., the roles of CA/CSA/CMS Administrator, LRA, RA Administrator, Systems Administrator, or Network Engineer).

-   **Help Desk Representative:** Help Desk Representatives may not serve in the role of CA/CSA/CMS Administrator, RA Administrator, System Administrator, or Network Engineer.

-   **PKI Consultant:** PKI Consultants may not serve in the roles of CA/CSA/CMS Administrators, System Administrators, Network Administrators, and Security Officers.

-   **Operations Manager:** The Operations Manager may not serve as CA/CSA/CMS Administrator, Systems Administrator, LRA, or Network Engineer.

-   []{#_Personnel_Controls .anchor}**Software Engineer:** Software Engineer may not assume any other roles

-   **Development Operations (DevOps):** Development Operations may not assume the LRA, Security Officer, Help Desk Representatives, Operations Manager or Software Engineer role.

## Personnel Controls

### Qualifications, Experience, and Clearance Requirements

Prior to the engagement of any person in the Certificate Management Process, whether as an employee, agent, or an independent contractor of the CA, the CA shall verify the identity and trustworthiness of such person.

Personnel who administer or operate components of the CA, CSA, and IdenTrust RA Systems and RA Systems, including LRAs are under the direct control of IdenTrust and meet the following requirements:

-   Successful completion of appropriate training;

-   Demonstrated ability to perform duties, as indicated by annual performance reviews;

-   Trustworthiness, as initially determined by a background investigation;

-   No other duties that would interfere or conflict with the duties of their Trusted Role;

-   Not previously relieved of duties in a Trusted Role for reasons of negligence or non-performance of duties, as indicated by employment records;

-   Not convicted of a felony offense, as indicated by a criminal background check; and

-   Appointed in writing by Operations Management or pursuant to a written contract with IdenTrust or in a Certificate of incumbency, as evidenced by records maintained for such purpose by such Organization.

Each Enterprise RA and the Sponsoring Organization which employs and to which such Enterprise RA acts as a limited LRA shall be required under or pursuant to a contract by and among the Enterprise RA, Sponsoring Organization, and IdenTrust, to provide evidence of or representations and warranties to IdenTrust as to the following concerning such Enterprise RA:

-   Successful completion of appropriate training programs as provided by IdenTrust;

-   Demonstrated ability to perform duties, as indicated by annual performance reviews;

-   No other duties that would interfere or conflict with the duties of their Enterprise RA Role;

<!-- -->

-   Passed Identity Proofing as per [Section 3.2](#initial-identity-validation);

-   The Sponsoring Organization that employees the Enterprise RA has authorized them and nominated them to fulfill the Enterprise RA functions for that entity; and

-   A representative of the Sponsoring Organization that employees the Individual elected as the Enterprise RA has signed the Enterprise RA addendum asserting such contractual obligations.

### Background Check Procedures

Persons appointed by IdenTrust to serve in Trusted Roles (with the exception of Enterprise RAs as explained above in [Section 5.3.1](#qualifications-experience-and-clearance-requirements)) have undergone a local and national criminal background check, a drug test, and a financial status check through national credit bureau databases. Other checks are performed as described below for the purposes listed:

-   Previous employers are contacted to determine whether the person is competent, reliable, and trustworthy;

-   High schools, colleges, and universities are contacted to verify the highest or most relevant degree;

-   Residency checks are performed to determine whether the person was and is a trustworthy neighbor;

-   Driver's license records are checked through a commercial database to determine if the person has a record of serious or criminal violations; and

-   A Social Security trace is performed to determine whether the person has a valid social security number. This check is required only if the country in which the duty is performed has social security number or a similar identifier.

-   A criminal history check is performed through a commercial database, to determine that the person has no previous felony convictions;

-   A credit history check is performed through a commercial database to determine that the person has not committed any fraud and is financially trustworthy; and

-   Professional references are contacted to determine that the person is competent, reliable, and trustworthy.

The period of investigation covers at least the last 5 years for employment, education, criminal, and references, and the last 3 years for places of residence. Regardless of the date of award, the highest educational degree is verified.

Background checks are renewed periodically. If the initial or subsequent background checks reveal a material misrepresentation by the Individual, substantially unfavorable comments from persons contacted, a criminal conviction, or personal financial problems, then it is brought to the attention of the Operations Manager and Security Officer who will evaluate the severity, type, magnitude, and frequency of the behavior or actions of the Individual, and determine the appropriate action to be taken, which may include removal from a Trusted Role.

RAs are obligated by contract and by this CP-CPS, to implement background check procedures equivalent to the ones explained above. To the extent that any of the foregoing cannot be met due to circumstances peculiar to that party, substantially similar procedures must be performed and may include background checks performed by government agencies or providers of such services in their jurisdictions.

### Training Requirements and Procedures

The CA shall provide all personnel performing information verification duties with skills-training that covers basic Public Key Infrastructure knowledge, authentication and vetting policies and procedures (including the CA's CP and/or CPS), common threats to the information verification process (including phishing and other social engineering tactics), and the TLS BR.

The CA shall maintain records of such training and ensure that personnel entrusted with Validation Specialist duties maintain a skill level that enables them to perform such duties satisfactorily.

The CA shall document that each Validation Specialist possesses the skills required by a task before allowing the Validation Specialist to perform that task.

The CA shall require all Validation Specialists to pass an examination provided by the CA on the information verification requirements outlined in the TLS BR.

All Individuals responsible for carrying out information verification responsibilities receive skill-enhancing training. This training encompasses fundamental Public Key Infrastructure knowledge, authentication and vetting policies and protocols (including the CA\'s CP and/or CPS), typical risks associated with the information verification process (such as phishing and other social engineering methods), and adherence to the TLS BR.

Records of this training are upheld to ensure that personnel assigned to Validation Specialist duties maintain the proficiency needed to execute their responsibilities effectively.

Before authorizing Validation Specialists to undertake TLS BR tasks, IdenTrust confirms the possession of essential skills by each specialist.

IdenTrust requires that all Validation Specialists successfully complete an assessment conducted by the internal compliance team. This assessment evaluates their understanding of the information verification requisites outlined in the TLS BR.

### Retraining Frequency and Requirements

All personnel in Trusted roles shall maintain skill levels consistent with the CA's training and performance programs.

Any significant change to the CA and RA Systems requires that personnel receive additional training. Through a change control processes, (See [Section 6.6](#life-cycle-technical-controls)) an awareness plan is prepared for any significant change to the Systems (e.g., a planned upgrade of CA equipment, software, or changes in procedures). All Trusted Role personnel undergo a retraining session once a year that includes a review of the applicable provisions of this CP- CPS under which they are operating, and a full review of all applicable policies and procedures.

Documentation identifying all personnel who received training and the level of training completed is maintained.

RAs are obligated by contract and by this CP-CPS, to retrain its personnel and maintain a record of the training provided.

### Job Rotation Frequency and Sequence

Job rotation is implemented when in the judgment of IdenTrust or RAs' management it is necessary to ensure the continuity and integrity of the IdenTrust's or RAs' ability to continually provide PKI-related services.

### Sanctions for Unauthorized Actions

In the event of actual or suspected unauthorized action by a person performing duties with respect to the operation of the Issuing CA or RA, the Issuing CA should suspend his or her access to the Issuing CA System.

Failure of any employee or agent of IdenTrust or an RA to comply with the provisions of this CP-CPS, or federal regulations, whether through negligence or malicious intent, will subject such Individual to appropriate administrative and disciplinary actions, which may include termination as an employee or agent, and possible civil and criminal sanctions. Any person performing a Trusted Role who is cited by management for unauthorized actions, inappropriate actions, or any other unsatisfactory investigation results will be immediately removed from the Trusted Role pending management review. Subsequent to management review, and discussion of actions or investigation results with the employee, he or she may be reassigned to the Trusted Role, transferred to a non-Trusted Role, or dismissed from employment as appropriate.

### Independent Contractor Requirements

The Issuing CA must ensure that contractor access to the Issuing CA site is in accordance with [Section 5.1.2](#physical-access), Physical Access.

Independent contractors who are assigned to perform Trusted Roles are subject to the duties and all requirements of this CP-CPS, including those described elsewhere in [Section 5.3](#_Personnel_Controls). Independent contractors are subject to sanctions stated in [Section 5.3.6](#sanctions-for-unauthorized-actions) for unauthorized actions or failure to comply with the provisions of this CP-CPS.

### Documentation Supplied to Personnel

CA and RA Personnel in Trusted Roles, including contractors, are provided with the documentation necessary to define and support the duties and procedures of the roles to which they are assigned. IdenTrust provides a copy of the CP-CPS, any relevant statutes, policies, and guidelines, and all technical and operational documentation needed to maintain, and integrate with the CA or RA Systems, as well as other relevant information to fulfill their tasks.

## Audit Logging Procedures

### Types of Events Recorded

The CA and each Delegated Third Party shall record events related to the security of their Certificate Systems, Certificate Management Systems, Root CA Systems, and Delegated Third Party Systems. The CA and each Delegated Third Party shall record events related to their actions taken to process a Certificate Request and to issue a Certificate, including all information generated and documentation received in connection with the Certificate Request; the time and date; and the personnel involved. The CA shall make these records available to its Qualified Auditor as proof of the CA's compliance with the TLS BR.

IdenTrust records events related to the security of their Certificate Systems, Certificate Management Systems, and Root CA Systems. IdenTrust records events related to their actions taken to process a Certificate Request and to issue a Certificate, including all information generated and documentation received in connection with the Certificate Request; the time and date; and the personnel involved.

IdenTrust logs records include the following elements:

1.  Date and time of event;

2.  Identity of the person making the journal record; and

3.  Description of the event.

IdenTrust's CA, CSA, and RA equipment automatically record all significant events related to the operations of the equipment. Events recorded include those that occur to the routers, firewalls, and other Network Equipment; at each host; within applications and databases; and at all physical security checkpoints.

IdenTrust staff members manually record all significant events that are not logged by the equipment.

RAs are obligated by contract and this CP-CPS, to record all significant events related to their operations.

For events recorded, the minimum information logged includes the following items: type of event, time of occurrence, the identity of the Individual or System that logged the event, who caused the event, and a success or failure indication. For some types of events, these minimums may be expanded to include items such as the source or destination of a message, or the disposition of a created object (e.g., a filename).

#### Router and Firewall Activities Log

Logging of router and firewall activities necessary to meet the requirements of [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded) (Subsection 3.6) must at a minimum include:

1.  Successful and unsuccessful login attempts to routers and firewalls; and

2.  Logging of all administrative actions performed on routers and firewalls, including configuration changes, firmware updates, and access control modifications; and

3.  Logging of all changes made to firewall rules, including additions, modifications, and deletions; and

4.  Logging of all System events and errors, including hardware failures, software crashes, and System restarts.

### Frequency of Processing Log

The Issuing CA must ensure that its audit logs are reviewed by CA personnel at least weekly and all significant events are explained in an audit log summary. Such reviews involve verifying that the log has not been tampered with, and then briefly inspecting all log entries, with a more thorough investigation of any alerts or irregularities in the logs. Supporting manual and electronic logs from the Issuing CA and RA should be compared where any action is deemed suspicious. Actions taken following these reviews must be documented.

IdenTrust Security Officers and System Administrators conduct reviews of all the audit log data through a combination of automated and manual means at least weekly. In order to ensure a thorough review of all data, the Security Officer selects all CA, CSA, and RA logs for review and a minimum of 25% of other security audit data generated since the last review for each category of audit data.

The Security Officer uses automated tools to scan logs for specific conditions. The Security Officer then reviews the output and produces a written summary of findings when significant events that require documentation occur. The reviews include the date, name of the reviewer, description of the event, details of findings, and recommendations for remediation or further investigation if appropriate. Such reviews involve verifying that the log has not been tampered with, and then briefly inspecting all log entries, with a more thorough investigation of any alerts or irregularities in the logs. The reviews include CA, CSA, and RA activities that are listed as recorded in [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded). These reviews are made available to IdenTrust's external auditor.

Restrictions are applied to the logs to prevent unauthorized access, deletion, or overwriting of data. Storage capability is monitored to ensure that sufficient space exists to prevent overflow conditions. Alerts are sent to a Security Officer if the space available becomes inadequate.

The security audit logs are moved monthly to the archive by Security Officer in accordance with [Section 5.4.4](#protection-of-audit-log).

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS, to implement controls that allow them to review logs consistent with practices outlined in this section. Enterprise RAs logs are collected electronically through the administrative interface provided by IdenTrust.

### Retention Period for Audit Log

IdenTrust retains audit logs for at least 2 years of:

1.  CA Certificate and Key lifecycle management event records Key Generation, backup, storage, recovery, archival, and destruction as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded) (1) after the later occurrence of:

    a.  the destruction of the CA Private Key; or

    b.  the Revocation or expiration of the final CA Certificate in that set of Certificates that have an X.509v3 basicConstraints extension with the cA field set to true and which share a common Public Key corresponding to the CA Private Key;

2.  Subscriber Certificate lifecycle management event records as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded) (2) after the expiration of the Subscriber Certificate;

3.  Any security event records as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded) (3) after the event occurred. All security audit logs, both electronic and non-electronic, are retained and made available during compliance audits.

Audit log information generated on CA, CSA, and RA equipment is kept on the equipment until the information is moved to the offsite archive facility described in in [Section 5.1.8](#off-site-backup) for IdenTrust secure registration messaging Protocol details. There are 90 days of active logs remaining on the equipment for analysis. The oldest 30 days -- e.g., logs dated between 90 and 120 days, are removed monthly to be archived by the Security Officer in accordance with [Section 5.4.4](#protection-of-audit-log). Electronic audit logs are deleted only after they have been backed up to archive media.

Only Security Officers are authorized to delete these logs and must first verify that the audit log data has been successfully backed up to archive media by checking hash values against the original and the backup copies.

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS, to implement controls that allow them to retain audit logs consistent with practices outlined in this section. Enterprise RAs logs are collected electronically through the administrative interface provided by IdenTrust.

### Protection of Audit Log

The audit log, to the extent possible, will not be open for reading or modification by any human, or by any automated process other than those that perform audit processing. Any entity that does not have modification access to the audit log may archive it (note that deletion requires modification access). Weekly audit data will be moved to a safe, secure storage location separate from the Issuing CA equipment.

The security audit logs are written simultaneously to separate network locations to ensure their safety and security. No Individual is given the permissions required to modify or delete files in all 3 locations. The log storage capability is monitored by the operating systems at each location to ensure that sufficient space exists to prevent overflow conditions. Logs for the current and 2 prior months are retained on each server and on the logging hosts to aid in troubleshooting. Alerts are sent to the System Administrators and to the Security Office if it appears that the space available will become inadequate.

The integrity of each archived audit log is ensured by the use of a checksum. The Security Office oversees procedures governing the archiving of all audit logs to ensure that archived data is protected from modification, deletion, or premature destruction. Each month, audit data and review summaries no longer needed on the hosts are archived and moved to a secure offsite storage location as described in [Section 5.1.8](#off-site-backup). As described previously, the audit logs and related materials are stored separately from the daily backups, and access to the offsite data is restricted to Security Officers.

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS to implement controls that allow them to prevent unauthorized access, deletion, or overwriting of data; and to back up the audit logs in a manner consistent with practices outlined in this section.

### Audit Log Backup Procedures

Audit logs and audit summaries must be backed up or copied if in manual form.

IdenTrust makes a backup of each audit log monthly as described in [Section 5.5.3](#protection-of-archive) and [Section 5.5.4](#archive-backup-procedures). Backup copies of the audit logs and audit summary data are transferred to the secure offsite location in locked containers separate from all other storage containers. They are also stored separately and can be retrieved only by the Security Office.

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS to implement controls that allow them to backup audit logs consistent with practices outlined in this section. Enterprise RAs logs are collected electronically through the administrative interface provided by IdenTrust.

### Audit Collection System (Internal vs. External)

Automated audit log collection systems are internal to the CA, CSA, RA, and Repository. These Systems invoke audit processes at System startup, which cease only at System shutdown. Processes are enforced technically through the operating system and a secondary monitoring application.

As described in [Section 5.5.4](#archive-backup-procedures), audit log collection systems are configured such that security audit data logs are protected against loss (e.g., overwriting or overflow of automated log files).

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS, to implement controls that allow them to ensure audit data are protected against loss in consistency with practices outlined in this section. Enterprise RA logs are collected electronically through the administrative interface provided by IdenTrust.

### Notification to Event-Causing Subject

IdenTrust provides no notice to the event-causing entity (i.e., Subscriber, Sponsoring Organization, or Device) that an event was audited.

### Vulnerability Assessments

The CA's security program must include an annual Risk Assessment that:

1.  Identifies foreseeable internal and external threats that could result in unauthorized access, disclosure, misuse, alteration, or destruction of any Certificate Data or Certificate Management Processes;

2.  Assesses the likelihood and potential damage of these threats, taking into consideration the sensitivity of the Certificate Data and Certificate Management Processes; and

3.  Assesses the sufficiency of the policies, procedures, information systems, technology, and other arrangements that the CA has in place to counter such threats.

IdenTrust undergoes or performs a Vulnerability Scan (i) within one week of receiving a request from the CA/B Forum, (ii) after any System or network changes that the CA determines are significant, and (iii) at least every 3 months, on public and private IP Addresses identified by the CA as the CA's Certificate Systems.

IdenTrust undergoes a Penetration Test on the CA's Certificate Systems on at least an annual basis and after infrastructure or application upgrades or modifications that the CA determines are significant;

IdenTrust records evidence that each Vulnerability Scan and Penetration Test was performed by a person or entity (or collective group thereof) with the skills, tools, proficiency, code of ethics, and independence necessary to provide a reliable Vulnerability Scan or Penetration Test. See [Section 8](#compliance-audit-and-other-assessments) for additional details.

IdenTrust does one of the following within 96 hours of the discovery of a Critical Vulnerability not previously addressed by the CA's vulnerability correction process:

-   Remediate the Critical Vulnerability;

-   If remediation of the Critical Vulnerability within 96 hours is not possible, create and implement a plan to mitigate the Critical Vulnerability, giving priority to (1) vulnerabilities with high CVSS scores, starting with the vulnerabilities the CA determines are the most critical (such as those with a CVSS score of 10.0) and (2) Systems that lack sufficient compensating controls that, if the vulnerability were left unmitigated, would allow external System control, code execution, privilege escalation, or system compromise; or

-   Document the factual basis for the CA's determination that the vulnerability does not require remediation because (a) the CA disagrees with the NVD rating, (b) the identification is a false positive, (c) the exploit of the vulnerability is prevented by compensating controls or an absence of threats; or (d) other similar reasons.

-   Apply recommended security patches to Certificate Systems within six (6) months of the security patch's availability, unless the CA documents that the security patch would introduce additional vulnerabilities or instabilities that outweigh the benefits of applying the security patch.

RAs are obligated by contract, this CPS, and the TrustID CP to implement controls that allow them to perform routine self-assessment.

## Records Archival

### Types of Records Archived

The CA shall and each Delegated Third Party shall archive all audit logs (as set forth in [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded)).

Additionally, the CA and each Delegated Third Party shall archive:

1.  Documentation related to the security of their Certificate Systems, Certificate Management Systems, and Root CA Systems; and

2.  Documentation related to their verification, Issuance, and Revocation of Certificate Requests and Certificates.

IdenTrust retains and archives all data through the life of TrustID PKI Certificates. Archive records are maintained locally for at least 3 months and archived offsite for at least 10 years and 6 months. The archive records are designed to be sufficiently detailed to establish the proper operation of the PKI or the validity of any Certificate (including those revoked or expired) issued by IdenTrust.

IdenTrust maintains and archives that information and more in the following records, in either electronic or paper format. The use of electronic records is preferred, and paper records are digitized whenever possible.

-   CA accreditation;

-   CP;

-   CPS;

-   Contractual obligations and other agreements concerning operations of the CA;

-   System and equipment configuration;

-   Modifications and updates to System or configuration;

-   Certificate Requests;

-   Record of re-key;

-   Revocation requests;

-   Subscriber Identity Proofing data per [Section 3.2.3](#authentication-of-individual-identity);

-   Documentation of receipt and Acceptance of Certificates;

-   Export of Private Keys;

-   Subscriber Agreements;

-   Documentation of loading, shipping, receipt, and zeroizing of Cryptographic Modules;

-   All Certificates issued or published;

-   Security audit data in accordance with [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded);

-   All changes to the trusted Public Keys;

-   All CRLs issued and/or published;

-   All routine Certificate validation transactions;

-   Other data or applications to verify archive contents;

-   Documentation required by compliance auditors; and

-   Subscriber encryption Private Keys that are archived/escrowed in accordance with this CPS.

RAs are obligated by contract, this CPS, and the TrustID CP to retain and archive data through the life of the contract with IdenTrust. After notification of the end of the Contract has occurred, IdenTrust will convene with the RA to agree on the terms to transfer the data to IdenTrust. The RA shall maintain the following records:

-   Contractual obligations and other agreements concerning operations of the RA;

-   Other agreements concerning the RA/LRA operations;

-   RA System and equipment configuration;

-   Modifications and updates to System or configuration;

-   Certificate Requests;

-   Security audit data in accordance with [Section 5.4.1](#types-of-events-recorded);

-   Revocation requests;

-   Subscriber Identity Proofing data per [Section 3.2.3](#authentication-of-individual-identity);

-   Documentation of receipt and Acceptance of Certificates;

-   Subscriber Agreements;

-   Documentation of loading, shipping, receipt, and zeroizing of Cryptographic Modules; and

-   Documentation required by compliance auditors.

Enterprise RAs logs are collected electronically through the administrative interface provided by IdenTrust.

### Retention Period for Archive

The CA and the Time-Stamping Authority must archive records for a period of at least 7 years, 6 months without any loss of data; less or greater retention archival period is permitted for external RAs and PKI Service Providers based on contractual requirements and the requirements of the current version of the TLS BR.

Archived audit logs (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#types-of-records-archived)) shall be retained for a period of at least 2 years from their record creation timestamp, or as long as they are required to be retained per Section 5.4.3, whichever is longer.

Additionally, the CA shall retain, for at least 2 years:

1.  All archived documentation related to the security of Certificate Systems, Certificate Management Systems, and Root CA Systems (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#types-of-records-archived)); and

2.  All archived documentation relating to the verification, Issuance, and Revocation of Certificate Requests and Certificates (as set forth in [Section 5.5.1](#types-of-records-archived)) after the later occurrence of one of such records and documentation were last relied upon in the verification, Issuance, or Revocation of Certificate Requests and Certificates; or

3.  the expiration of the Subscriber Certificates relying upon such records and documentation.

If the original media cannot retain the data for the required period, a mechanism to periodically transfer the archived data to new media will be defined by the archive site. Software applications required to process the archive data will also be maintained for as long as necessary. After the minimum archive retention period, external RAs and PKI Service Providers are responsible for maintaining the authenticity and integrity of their own valuable documents.

Archive records are maintained locally for at least 3 months and archived offsite for at least 10 years and 6 months.

IdenTrust maintains copies of the applications that can read these types of files for at least the retention period.

RAs are obligated by contract, this CPS, and the TrustID CP to implement controls that allow them to retain records and copies of the application that can read those files for 10 years and 6 months.

### Protection of Archive

No unauthorized Individual will be able to write to, modify, or delete the archive. However, archived records may be moved to another medium. The contents of the archive will not be released as a whole, except as required by law. Records of Individual transactions may be released upon request of any entities involved in the transaction or their legally recognized agents. Archive media will be stored in a separate, safe, secure storage facility.

Archived data is stored in a separate, offsite storage facility identified in [Section 5.1.6](#media-storage). Records are uniquely identified. The media used for retaining the archived data is specifically chosen and tested to ensure that the archived data will be conserved on the same media for the minimum retention period defined in [Section 5.5.2](#retention-period-for-archive).

The contents of the archive will not be released as a whole, except as required by law, as described in [Section 9.4](#privacy-of-personal-information). Access to the offsite storage facility is strictly limited to Individuals who have been authorized by the IdenTrust Head of Operations or the Security Office. IdenTrust maintains a list of people authorized to access the archive records and makes this list available to its auditors during compliance audits. Certain sensitive materials are stored in a physically separate area within the offsite storage location, and access to the materials is limited to IdenTrust's Security Officers. The IdenTrust Security Office oversees procedures governing the archival of the audit log to ensure that archived data is protected from deletion or destruction during the data retention period.

The integrity of the electronic archive data is protected through multiple means, while also ensuring that no transfer of medium will invalidate the applied checksum, and any attempt to modify the data will be evident. Repository information is archived in a human readable form. IdenTrust maintains copies of the applications that can read these types of files for at least the retention period.

RAs are obligated by contract, and by this CP-CPS to implement controls that allow them to protect the archive media from disclosure, modification, or destruction consistent with practices in this section.

### Archive Backup Procedures

Adequate backup procedures must be in place so that in the event of the loss or destruction of the primary archives, a complete set of backup copies will be readily available within a short period of time.

IdenTrust does not have a backup archival facility because 3 copies of each archive log are maintained in separate locations. All archive copies are stored in the offsite storage facility and are readily available within a short time in the event of loss or destruction of the primary Datacenter or Secure Room.

### Requirements for Times-Stamping of Records

CA archive records shall be automatically time-stamped as they are created.

See [Section 6.8](#time-stamping).

### Archive Collection System (Internal or External)

Archived data is collected internally and stored in a separate, offsite storage facility identified in [Section 5.1.6](#media-storage).

### Procedures to Obtain and Verify Archive Information

No stipulation.

## Key Changeover

An End Entity may only apply to renew his, her, or its TrustID Certificate within three months before the expiration of one of the Keys, provided the previous Certificate has not been revoked. An End Entity, the Issuing CA, or the RA may initiate this Key changeover process. Automated Key changeover is permitted.

When IdenTrust re-keys its signature Private Key and thus generates a new Public Key, it will make it publicly known in the Repository and notify the PMA, RAs, and Subscribers that rely on its CA Certificate, that it has changed its Keys.

## Compromise and Disaster Recovery

### Incident and Compromise Handling Procedures 

CA Organizations shall have an Incident Response Plan and a Disaster Recovery Plan.

The CA shall document a business continuity and disaster recovery procedures designed to notify and reasonably protect Application Software Suppliers, Subscribers, and Relying Parties in the event of a disaster, security compromise, or business failure. The CA is not required to publicly disclose its business continuity plans but shall make its business continuity plan and security plans available to the CA's auditors upon request. The CA shall annually test, review, and update these procedures.

The business continuity plan must include:

1.  The conditions for activating the plan,

2.  Emergency procedures,

3.  Fallback procedures,

4.  Resumption procedures,

5.  A maintenance schedule for the plan;

6.  Awareness and education requirements;

7.  The responsibilities of the Individuals;

8.  Recovery time objective (RTO);

9.  Regular testing of contingency plans.

10. The CA's plan to maintain or restore the CA's business operations in a timely manner following interruption to or failure of critical business processes

11. A requirement to store critical cryptographic materials (i.e., secure cryptographic device and activation materials) at an alternate location;

12. What constitutes an acceptable system outage and recovery time

13. How frequently backup copies of essential business information and software are taken;

14. The distance of recovery facilities to the CA's main site; and

15. Procedures for securing its facility to the extent possible during the period of time following a disaster and prior to restoring a secure environment either at the original or a remote site.

IdenTrust documents and maintains security incident response and compromise handling policies and procedures, as well as disaster recovery and business continuity plans. Such procedures and plans are available for onsite review by its auditors and major Authorized Relying Parties under appropriate non-disclosure agreements. Below is a synopsis of the incident response policies and procedures.

For each incident, an initial goal of the incident response plan is to determine the degree and scope of the incident. This includes a determination of the cause or source of the incident (e.g., internal System failure, external malicious attack, user error), and the potential severity of the harm caused by the incident. For all incidents, data is collected and analyzed to determine, among other things:

-   Whether a crime has been committed, and if so, whether evidence can be collected that will be helpful to law enforcement;

-   What data was disclosed or compromised, and whether there was a Private Key compromise; and

-   What steps need to be taken immediately to mitigate further damage.

For anticipated threats, IdenTrust maintains step-by-step procedures and task assignments for members of the incident response team, depending on the type of incident that is believed to have occurred. IdenTrust annually tests, reviews, and updates these procedures. Procedures are tested at least annually as part of the disaster recovery exercise.

### Computing Resources, Software, and/or Data Are Corrupted

IdenTrust backs up essential information in near-real time to its disaster recovery site, as described in [Section 5.1.8](#off-site-backup). IdenTrust also performs backups of all its production CA Systems daily, also as described in [Section 5.1.8](#off-site-backup). Backup tapes and backups of Cryptographic Modules are stored offsite in a secure location. In the event of a disaster in which the primary Datacenter becomes inoperative, the disaster recovery site can take over Certificate validation operations promptly and can provide all other essential CA operations within 72 hours. If both principal and backup CA operations become inoperative, IdenTrust's CA operations will be re-initiated on appropriate hardware using backup copies of software and Cryptographic Modules.

Re-initiation will occur according to one of the following contingencies:

-   If the IdenTrust CA signature Keys are not destroyed, IdenTrust CA operations will be reestablished, giving priority to the ability to generate Certificate status information within the CRL Issuance schedule specified in [Section 4.9.7](#crl-issuance-frequency).

-   If the IdenTrust CA signature Keys are destroyed, IdenTrust CA operation will be reestablished as quickly as possible, giving priority to the generation of a new IdenTrust CA Key Pair and Certificate with new DN. The old IdenTrust CA Certificate will be revoked, and notification will be placed on a CRL as specified in [Section 4.9.3](#procedure-for-revocation-request); new Certificates will be issued.

Subscribers will be notified and instructed via email and a secure IdenTrust site (e.g., <https://secure.identrust.com>) on how to remove the old Root CA from their Certificate stores and install the new root in their Certificate stores.

If a CA (i.e., Root or Subordinate CA) cannot issue a CRL before the time specified in the next-update field of its currently valid CRL, then the Relying Parties and all CAs that have issued Certificates to the CA will be notified informally via telephone call immediately. This call will be followed formally by a Certificate-based communication if possible; otherwise, by a written letter sent via courier service.

A Subordinate CA Certificate will be revoked if Revocation services are not reestablished within a reasonable period of time. The period of time will be established by the highest-ranking IdenTrust Operations Manager and representatives from the IdenTrust's Risk Management Committee after analyzing the risk exposure at the time. However, the CA may be revoked at any time. As guidelines, this period should not exceed 18 hours after a Revocation has been requested of any Certificate issued under the CA; or 72 hours after the last CRLs next update, whichever occurs earlier.

When the Root CA Certificate is unable to issue a CRL, the highest-ranking IdenTrust Operations Manager and representatives from the IdenTrust Risk Management Committee will establish the risk exposure and determine whether to stand up a new Root CA Certificate. If a CA has requested Revocation of its Certificate by the root, the risk exposure must be considered as high, and within an 18-hour period after the Revocation has been requested, the procedures described in a prior paragraph in this section are used to revoke the old Root CA Certificate and to establish and promulgate the new Root CA Certificate.

### Entity Private Key Compromise Procedures

IdenTrust has developed a Private Key compromise plan to address the procedures that will be followed in the event of a compromise of the signature Private Key used by IdenTrust to issue TrustID Certificates. The plan includes procedures for (and documentation of) revoking all affected TrustID Certificates it has issued, and promptly notifying all Subscribers and all Relying Parties.

If IdenTrust signature Keys are compromised or lost (such that compromise is possible even though not certain), IdenTrust will:

-   Immediately notify all CAs with whom it has cross-certified;

-   Revoke all TrustID Certificates it has issued using that Key and provide appropriate notice;

-   Generate a new IdenTrust Key Pair using appropriate procedures as outlined elsewhere in this CPS;

-   Distribute its new CA Certificate using the reliable out-of-band means allowed by this CPS;

-   Issue new CA Certificates to Subordinate CAs in accordance with this CPS; and

-   Ensure all CRLs are signed using the new Key.

IdenTrust will investigate what caused the compromise or loss, and what measures have been taken to preclude recurrence.

### Business Continuity Capabilities After a Disaster

IdenTrust has a disaster recovery/business resumption plan in place (Business Continuity Plan or BCP) that allows IdenTrust to reconstitute the CA within 72 hours of catastrophic failure. IdenTrust's business continuity and disaster recovery plans allow for other nonessential Systems to be brought into operation later than 72 hours.

If for any reason the CA installation is physically damaged and all copies of the CA signature Key are destroyed as a result, IdenTrust will notify any applicable Policy authorities. Relying Parties may decide of their own volition whether to continue to use Certificates signed with the destroyed Private Key pending reestablishment of CA operation with new Certificates.

## CA or RA Termination

In the event that it is necessary for IdenTrust or an RA to cease operation, all affected parties will be notified of the planned termination, promptly and as far in advance as is commercially reasonable. A termination plan will be created and submitted to the IdenTrust PMA. The termination plan will propose methods of minimizing the disruption to the operations of all parties caused by the planned termination and also include provisions for the termination of the RA, termination of contractual relationship with a sponsoring Organization with Enterprise RAs, termination of the Issuer CA and termination of the Root CA.

# TECHNICAL SECURITY CONTROLS

## Key Pair Generation and Installation

### Key Pair Generation

#### CA Key Pair Generation

For CA Key Pairs that are either

1.  used as a CA Key Pair for a Root CA Certificate or

2.  used as a CA Key Pair for a Subordinate CA Certificate, where the Subordinate CA is not the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA,

the CA Shall:

1.  prepare and follow a Key Generation Script,

2.  have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process, and

3.  have a Qualified Auditor issue a report opining that the CA followed its Key Ceremony during its Key and Certificate generation process and the controls used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the Key Pair.

For other CA Key Pairs that are for the operator of the Root CA or an Affiliate of the Root CA, the CA should:

1.  prepare and follow a Key Generation Script and

2.  have a Qualified Auditor witness the CA Key Pair generation process or record a video of the entire CA Key Pair generation process.

In all cases, the CA shall:

1.  generate the CA Key Pair in a Physically Secured Environment as described in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;

2.  generate the CA Key Pair using personnel in Trusted Roles under the principles of multiple person control and split knowledge;

3.  generate the CA Key Pair within Cryptographic Modules meeting the applicable technical and business requirements as disclosed in the CA's Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement;

4.  log its CA Key Pair generation activities; and

5.  maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Private Key was generated and protected in conformance with the procedures described in its Certificate Policy and/or Certification Practice Statement and (if applicable) its Key Generation Script.

Cryptographic Keying material used by IdenTrust to sign Certificates, CRLs, or status information is generated in a FIPS-140 validated Cryptographic Module. IdenTrust Cryptographic Modules meet FIPS 140-1/2 Level 3.

The CA and CSA Key Generation ceremonies are performed in the Secure Room. The Key Generation ceremony is scripted, video-recorded, and witnessed by an internal auditor, attesting that keys were protected in a manner consistent with the requirements defined in [Section 6.2](#private-key-protection-and-cryptographic-module-engineering-controls).

The Root CA Key Pair generation ceremony is witnessed by IdenTrust Qualified Auditor in order to observe the process and the controls over the integrity and confidentiality of the Root CA Key Pairs produced. The Qualified Auditor must then issue a report opining that the CA, during its Root CA Key Pair and Certificate generation process:

1.  Documented its Root CA Key Generation and protection procedures in its Certificate Policy, and its Certification Practices Statement;

2.  Included appropriate detail in its Root Key Generation Script;

3.  Maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that the Root CA Key Pair was generated and protected in conformity with the procedures described in its CP-CPS and with its Root Key Generation Script;

4.  Performed during the Root CA Key Generation process, all the procedures required by its Root Key Generation Script.

The Key Generation ceremony is performed by personnel in Trusted Roles who use different security Keys at the appropriate time depending on whether Key Generation, Certificate generation, or a Cryptographic Module backup/cloning operation is being performed. The scripts and video recordings are made available to independent third party auditors during the annual audit for examination.

#### RA Key Pair Generation

No stipulation.[]{#_Subscriber_Key_Pair .anchor}

#### Subscriber Key Pair Generation

The CA shall reject a Certificate Request if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1.  The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes) and/or [Section 6.1.6](#public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);

2.  There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;

3.  The CA is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;

4.  The CA have previously been notified that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise, using the procedure for Revocation request as described in [Section 4.9.3](#procedure-for-revocation-request) and [Section 4.9.12](#special-requirements-for-re-key-compromise);

5.  The Public Key corresponds to an industry-demonstrated weak Private Key. For requests submitted on or after November 15, 2024, at least the following precautions are implemented:

    1.  In the case of Debian weak keys vulnerability (<https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>), the CA shall reject all keys found at <https://github.com/cabforum/Debian-weak-keys/>

    2.  for each Key type (e.g.,Â RSA, ECDSA) and size listed in the Repository. For all other keys meeting the requirements ofÂ [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes) with the exception of RSA Key sizes greater than 8192 bits, IdenTrust shall reject Debian weak keys.

    3.  In the case of ROCA vulnerability, the CA shall reject keys identified by the tools available at <https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca> or equivalent.

    4.  In the case of Close Primes vulnerability (<https://fermatattack.secvuln.info/>), the CA shall reject weak keys which can be factored within 100 rounds using Fermat's factorization method.

> Suggested tools for checking for weak keys can be found here: <https://cabforum.org/resources/tools/>

If the server Subscriber Certificate will contain anÂ extKeyUsageÂ extension containing either the valuesÂ id-kp-serverAuthÂ \[[RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280)\] orÂ anyExtendedKeyUsageÂ \[[RFC 5280](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280)\], the CA shall not generate a Key Pair on behalf of a server Subscriber, and shall not Accept a Certificate Request using a Key Pair previously generated by the CA.

IdenTrust reject a Certificate Request if one or more of the following conditions are met:

1.  The Key Pair does not meet the requirements set forth in [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes) and/or [Section 6.1.6](#public-key-parameters-generation-and-quality-checking);

2.  There is clear evidence that the specific method used to generate the Private Key was flawed;

3.  IdenTrust is aware of a demonstrated or proven method that exposes the Applicant's Private Key to compromise;

4.  IdenTrust have previously been notified that the Applicant's Private Key has suffered a Key Compromise, using the procedure for Revocation request as described in [Section 4.9.3](#procedure-for-revocation-request) and [Section 4.9.12](#special-requirements-for-re-key-compromise);

5.  The Public Key corresponds to an industry-demonstrated weak Private Key. For requests submitted on or after November 15, 2024, at least the following precautions are implemented:

    1.  In the case of Debian weak keys vulnerability (<https://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys>), IdenTrust shall reject all keys found at <https://github.com/cabforum/Debian-weak-keys/> for each Key type (e.g.Â RSA, ECDSA) and size listed in the Repository. For all other keys meeting the requirements ofÂ [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes) with the exception of RSA Key sizes greater than 8192 bits, IdenTrust shall reject Debian weak keys.

    2.  In the case of ROCA vulnerability, IdenTrust shall reject keys identified by the tools available at <https://github.com/crocs-muni/roca> or equivalent.

    3.  In the case of Close Primes vulnerability (<https://fermatattack.secvuln.info/>), IdenTrust shall reject weak keys which can be factored within 100 rounds using Fermat's factorization method.

> Suggested tools for checking for weak keys can be found here: <https://cabforum.org/resources/tools/>

If the Subscriber Certificate contains anÂ extKeyUsageÂ extension containing either the valuesÂ id-kp-serverAuthÂ \[RFC 5280\] orÂ anyExtendedKeyUsageÂ \[RFC 5280\], IdenTrust shall not generate a Key Pair on behalf of a server Subscriber, and shall not Accept a Certificate Request using a Key Pair previously generated by IdenTrust.

### Private Key Delivery to Subscriber

Parties other than the Subscriber shall not archive the Subscriber Private Key without authorization by the Subscriber.

If the CA or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an Organization not affiliated with the Subscriber, then the CA shall revoke all Certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

When the encryption Keys and Certificates are not escrowed, the System allows the Subscriber to generate the Private Keys in the same way signature Keys are generated. Non-escrowed encryption Private Keys will be generated and remain within the boundaries of the hardware or software Cryptographic Module where they are generated.

If IdenTrust or any of its designated RAs become aware that a Subscriber's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an Organization not affiliated with the Subscriber, then IdenTrust shall revoke all Certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### Public Key Delivery to Certificate Issuer

The Subscriber's Public Key is delivered to IdenTrust or the RA (which in turn is delivered to IdenTrust) in a secure and trustworthy manner. Should the initial information be sent to an RA, that information will be securely forwarded (through any form of digital communications) to IdenTrust. The delivery of the Public Key, in a PKCS#10 structure, binds the Private and Public Keys, through a Digital Signature, and is submitted to the CA during a server-authenticated SSL/TLS-encrypted session.

Before the retrieval process, an Enterprise RA enrolls applications in bulk (i.e., a bulk load file) of Applicants/PKI Sponsors and approves Issuance of a Certificate to the Subscribers and PKI Sponsors. Activation Code(s) is/are generated and sent via a verified channel to the Applicant/PKI Sponsor before the time of retrieval. The Applicant/PKI Sponsor uses the Activation Code(s) in a server-authenticated SSL/TLS-encrypted session during which the Public Key is submitted to the RA/CA in a PKCS#10 and a Certificate is returned back during the same session.

### CA Public Key Delivery to Relying Parties

IdenTrust and its RAs ensure that Subscribers and Relying Parties receive and maintain the trust anchor(s) in a trustworthy fashion. Methods implemented for this delivery may include:

1.  The Public Key may be delivered to Subscribers during the Certificate retrieval process for their own Subscriber's Certificates during the server-authenticated SSL/TLS-encrypted session as part of a message formatted in accordance with the PKCS#7.

2.  The Public Key may also be delivered through the cryptographic container in the major browsers. IdenTrust maintains a trust anchor for the TrustID program that is embedded in the browser through their CA Root programs. This process requires fulfilling specific requirements by the browser manufacturers including providing them with the trust anchor in a secure manner. Browsers distribute the trust anchor and any updates along with the standard distribution of their software in a secure manner.

3.  Relying Parties may also obtain the trust anchor(s) (e.g., Root CA) Certificates from IdenTrust's secure website. An email or other communication may be sent to Participants directing them to download the trust anchor(s) Certificate at an https:// website secured with a valid server Certificate that chains to one of IdenTrust's Root CA Certificates in the browser. Alternatively, Subscribers and Relying Parties may be directed to an http:// website that is not secured in which case, IdenTrust will provide the hash or fingerprint via authenticated out-of-band sources (i.e., IdenTrust Customer Support)

In cases where the RA manages the insertion of the Certificate and Root CA into the Cryptographic Module, IdenTrust provides the trust anchor(s) Certificate securely to the RA using physical in-person delivery by an IdenTrust PKI Consultant during initial System setup. Then, the RA is obligated by contract, the TrustID CP, and this CPS to ensure the Subscriber receives the Root CA Certificate in a trustworthy fashion.

### Key Sizes

For RSA Key Pairs the CA shall:

-   Ensure that the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits, and;

-   Ensure that the modulus size, in bits, is evenly divisible by 8.

For ECDSA Key Pairs, the CA shall:

-   Ensure that the Key represents a valid point on the NIST P-256, NIST P-384 or NIST P-521 elliptic curve.

No other algorithms or Key sizes are permitted.

For Keys corresponding to Root and Subordinate CAs:

-   If the Key is RSA, then the modulus must be at least 4096 bits in length.

-   If the Key is ECDSA, then the curve must be one of NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521.

For Keys corresponding to Subscribers:

-   If the Key is RSA, then the modulus size, when encoded, is at least 2048 bits in and is evenly divisible by 8

-   If the Key is ECDSA, then the curve must be one of NIST P-256, P-384, or P-521.

### Public Key Parameters Generation and Quality Checking

For RSA Key Pairs: the CA shall confirm that the value of the public exponent is an odd number equal to 3 or more. Additionally, the public exponent should be in the range between 2 ^16^+1 and 2^256^-1. The modulus should also have the following characteristics: an odd number, not the power of a prime, and have no factors smaller than 752. (See [NIST SP 800-89, Section 5.3.3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/89/final).)

For ECDSA Key Pairs: The CA should confirm the validity of all keys using either the ECC Full Public Key Validation Routine or the ECC Partial Public Key Validation Routine. (See NIST SP 800-56A: Revision 2, Section 5.6.2.3.2 and 5.6.2.3.3).

Cryptographic Modules and associated software platforms used by CAs, the CSA, and Subscribers and RAs have been validated as conforming to FIPS 186-2 and provide random number generation and onboard creation of 2048-bit Key lengths for RSA Public Key Generation.

When IdenTrust implements Elliptic Curve Public Key parameters, they will be selected from the set specified in [Section 7.1.3](#algorithm-object-identifiers) Algorithm Object Identifiers.

The public exponent is in the range between 2 ^16^+1 and 2^256^-1. The modulus is an odd number, not the power of a prime, and has no factors smaller than 752.

### Key Usage Purposes (as per X509 v3 Key Usage Field)

IdenTrust does not use Private Keys corresponding to the Root CA Certificates to sign Certificates except in the following cases:

1.  Self-signed Certificates to represent the Root CA itself;

2.  Certificates for Subordinate CAs and Cross Certificates;

3.  Certificates for infrastructure purposes (e.g., administrative role Certificates, internal CA operational device Certificates); and

4.  Certificates for OCSP Response verification.

## Private Key Protection and Cryptographic Module Engineering Controls

The CA shall implement physical and logical safeguards to prevent unauthorized Certificate Issuance. Protection of the CA Private Key outside the validated system or device specified inÂ [Section 6.2.7](#private-key-storage-on-cryptographic-module)Â must consist of physical security, encryption, or a combination of both, implemented in a manner that prevents disclosure of the Private Key. The CA shall encrypt its Private Key with an algorithm and key-length that, according to the state of the art, are capable of withstanding cryptanalytic attacks for the residual life of the encrypted Key or Key part.

### Cryptographic Module Standards and Controls

IdenTrust uses only FIPS 140-1/2 Level 3-validated hardware Cryptographic Modules for the CA, the OCSP (CSA), and backup Cryptographic Modules. These modules do not allow the output of the private asymmetric Key to plaintext.

The installation, removal, and destruction of all Cryptographic Modules holding CA (i.e., Root or Subordinate CA) and CSA Keys is documented in writing, approved by management, witnessed, and video recorded.

### Private Key (N out of M) Multi-Person Control

The CA and CSA signature Private Keys are stored in the Secure Room under multi-person control as discussed in [Section 5.1.2](#physical-access). The PIN Entry Device Keys (PED Keys) are kept in a separate safe. At least one CA Administrator and one System Administrator are required, along with the additional presence of a Security Officer, to retrieve and activate the CA or CSA signature Private Keys.

For purposes of disaster recovery, backups of CA and CSA signature Private Keys are made under 2-person control and are stored in the Secure Room and in a secure off-site facility where 2-person controls are implemented as explained in [Section 5.1.6](#media-storage), [Section 5.1.8](#off-site-backup), and [Section 5.2.2](#number-of-persons-required-per-task).

This separation-of-duties/Multi-Party Control prevents a single Individual from gaining access to a CA or CSA signature Private Keys.

The Individuals taking part in tasks that require 2-person control and separation of duties principles are Trusted Roles within IdenTrust. As such, their names are part of a list maintained within the Operations group and made available during audits (See [Section 5.2.1](#trusted-roles)).

### Private Key Escrow

#### Escrow of CA Signature Private Key

IdenTrust does not escrow the CA Private Keys used to sign Certificates and CRLs

#### Escrow of Subscriber's Signature Private Keys

IdenTrust does not escrow Subscriber's signature Private Keys. RAs are prohibited under this TrustID CP-CPS from escrowing the signature Private Keys of Subscribers.

#### Escrow of Subscriber's Encryption Private Keys

Subscriber's encryption Private Keys may be escrowed to enable Key recovery. Encryption Private Key escrow is decided on an implementation specific basis.

### Private Key Backup

The backup of all other CA Keys is performed during a ceremony that is scripted, video recorded and witnessed under the same controls used for the original Key Generation. PED Keys are kept under 2-person control as explained in [Section 5.1.2.1](#_Physical_Access_for).

IdenTrust stores the Root CA and all other CA Private Keys and one of the copies in the Secure Room. The second backup of the Root CA and all other CA's signature Private Keys are kept in a secure off-site facility. Access to these Private Keys is documented as explained in [Section 5.1.6](#media-storage).

#### Backup of Subscriber's Signature Private Key

A Subscriber may optionally back up his, her, or its own Private Key. If so, the Key must be copied and stored in encrypted form and protected at a level no lower than stipulated for the primary version of the Key.

### Private Key Archival

Parties other than the Subordinate CA shall not archive the Subordinate CA Private Keys without authorization by the Subordinate CA.

IdenTrust does not archive its CA signature Private Keys.

### Private Key Transfer Into or From a Cryptographic Module

If the Issuing CA generated the Private Key on behalf of the Subordinate CA, then the Issuing CA shall encrypt the Private Key for transport to the Subordinate CA. If the Issuing CA becomes aware that a Subordinate CA's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an Organization not affiliated with the Subordinate CA, then the Issuing CA shall revoke all Certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

CA and CSA Private Keys are generated on a FIPS 140-1/2 Level 3 validated Cryptographic Module that allows for a "cloning" process that creates a copy of the Private Keys. IdenTrust uses the cloning process to create one or more copies for purposes of business continuity. The CA Private Keys are backed up in accordance with [Section 6.2.4](#private-key-backup).

If IdenTrust becomes aware that a Subordinate CA's Private Key has been communicated to an unauthorized person or an Organization not affiliated with the Subordinated CA, then IdenTrust will proceed to revoke all Certificates that include the Public Key corresponding to the communicated Private Key.

### Private Key Storage on Cryptographic Module

The CA shall protect its Private Key in a System or device that has been validated as meeting at least FIPS 140-2 level 3, FIPS 140-3 level 3, or an appropriate Common Criteria Protection Profile or Security Target, EAL 4 (or higher), which includes requirements to protect the Private Key and other assets against known threats.

IdenTrust's CA and CSA Private Keys are stored in Systems or devices that have been validated as meeting at least FIPS 140-2 level 3, FIPS 140-3 level 3 Cryptographic Modules.

### Method of Activating Private Key

CA and CSA Private Keys are activated by using Activation Data stored securely and separately from the Cryptographic Modules in which they are kept. Activation of the Private Key requires a PED Key to be connected to the module. The PED Keys and Cryptographic Modules are stored in separate safes. PED Keys and Cryptographic Modules are retrieved and used always under 2-person control. The Private Key is activated by the use of the PED Key during a Key Generation ceremony.

Subscribers must protect their Private Key from unauthorized use with a strong password, whose constraints are consistent with a FIPS 140-1/2 module specification. Subscribers of Business Certificates are instructed to protect their Private Key from unauthorized use with a strong password. Subscribers are obligated by contract, the TrustID CP, and this CPS to authenticate to the module before the activation of the Private Key, as well as to protect the password or other data used to activate it from disclosure.

### Method of Deactivating Private Key

The CA and CSA Cryptographic Modules when active are not exposed to unauthorized access. The modules are maintained in the Secure Room which requires 2-person control. In addition, the modules are enclosed in locked steel cabinets. When not in use, a module is deactivated via logout procedures, removed, and stored in accordance with [Section 5.1.2.1](#_Physical_Access_for).

Subscribers are notified of their obligation to not leave their Cryptographic Modules unattended or open to unauthorized access while active. Subscribers are required to deactivate the modules either by a manual logout or by configuring a passive timeout that does it automatically.

### Method of Destroying Private Key

Upon expiration or Revocation of a CA, CSA, or RA System Certificate, or other termination of use of the signature Private Key, all copies of the signature Private Key are securely destroyed by IdenTrust personnel in Trusted Roles. When no longer needed, all Private Keys are destroyed in accordance with the FIPS 140-validated zeroize destruction method that is part of the Cryptographic Module's design (physical destruction of the Cryptographic Module is not required).

Subscribers are notified of their obligation to destroy their signing Private Keys and are provided instructions on zeroizing, re-initializing, or destroying the Cryptographic Modules when they are no longer needed, or when the Certificates to which they correspond are expired or revoked.

To ensure future access to encrypted data, Subscriber encryption Private Keys are secured in long-term backups by IdenTrust.

### Cryptographic Module Rating

Requirements for Cryptographic Modules are as stated above in [Section 6.2.1](#cryptographic-module-standards-and-controls).

## Other Aspects of Key PAIR Management

### Public Key Archival

No stipulation.

### Certificate Operational Periods and Key Pair Usage Periods

Subscriber Certificates issued on or after 1 September 2020 should not have a Validity Period greater than 397 days and must not have a Validity Period greater than 398 days.

For the purpose of calculations, a day is measured as 86,400 seconds. Any amount of time greater than this, including fractional seconds and/or leap seconds, shall represent an additional day. For this reason, Subscriber Certificates should not be issued for the maximum permissible time by default, in order to account for such adjustments.

IdenTrust Certificates and corresponding Keys Pairs have maximum Validity Periods as follows:

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **TrustID Certificated Operational and Key Usage Periods**                                      
  ------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- --------------------------
  **Key Type**                                                 **Private Key Usage Period(\*)**   **Certificate Lifetime**

  Root CA                                                      No stipulation                     20 years

  Subordinate CAs Human and Others                             No stipulation                     15 years

  CSA OCSP Responder                                           No stipulation                     3 years

  End Entity                                                   No stipulation                     398 days
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\* Subscriber Key Pair must be replaced in accordance with the provisions of [Section 3.3](#identification-and-authentication-for-re-key-requests).

## Activation Data

### Activation Data Generation and Installation

A pass-phrase, PIN, or other Activation Data is used to protect access to the Private Keys used by IdenTrust or Subscribers.

IdenTrust uses a manually-held Key share PED and PED Keys to activate its Private Keys for CAs and CSAs. The Activation Data meets the requirements of FIPS 140-1/2 Level 3. The PED and PED Keys are held in the Secure Room under the 2-person controls to enforce Split-Knowledge Technique.

Subscribers are instructed to use strong passwords in accordance with the FIPS 140 guideline in accordance with the level of the Cryptographic Module.

### Activation Data Protection

Activation Data for Cryptographic Modules used by CAs and CSAs are protected by keeping the PED Keys in separate safes inside of the Secure Room. Access to the Secure Room requires 2 Individuals in Trusted Roles. Access to the content in the safe requires a password and a Key, each one held by a different Individual to enforce Split-Knowledge Technique.

When Activation Data is in the form of a PIN or password, LRAs, Enterprise RAs, Subscribers and PKI Sponsors are notified of their obligation to protect Activation Data as follows:

-   It should be memorized, not written down;

-   If written down, it must be secured at the level of the data that the associated Cryptographic Module is used to protect, and will not be stored with the Cryptographic Module; and

-   Activation Data must never be shared with or disclosed to another Individual.

Alternatively, Activation Data could be biometric in nature.

### Other Aspects of Activation Data

The TrustID Policy makes no stipulation on the life of Activation Data; however, it should be changed periodically to decrease the likelihood that it has been discovered.

## Computer Security Controls

### Specific Computer Security Technical Requirements

The CA shall enforce multi-factor authentication for all accounts capable of directly causing Certificate Issuance.

All IdenTrust TrustID CA Systems for all accounts capable of directly causing Certificate Issuance, including CA, CSA, and RA server side, incorporate proper user Identity Proofing methodology. This methodology includes the use of user ID/password, Private/Public Key, and/or biometrics authentication schemes, plus Multi-Factor Authentication where such is supported. The use and enforcement of password security are in accordance with the IdenTrust security Policy and supporting security guidelines.

### Computer Security Rating

No stipulation.

## Life Cycle Technical Controls

### System Development Controls

For commercial off-the-shelf software, IdenTrust selects vendors that design and develop applications using formal development methodologies and as a consequence has received security certifications supporting their assertions.

IdenTrust develops some PKI software components. Standard development methodologies are used. Strict quality assurance is maintained throughout the process. Documentation is maintained supporting the process. Development and testing environments are maintained on separate servers in a separate network from the main operational environment with appropriate segregation rights restricting developers and testers from having access to production equipment.

When open source software is used, it is selected focusing on specific functionality, it goes through unit and integration testing on a controlled environment. Then, when it is used in development, the entire developed module goes through the standard change control process.

If a CA uses Linting software developed by third parties, it should monitor for updated versions of that software and plan for updates no later than three (3) months from the release of the update.

When IdenTrust uses Linting software developed by third parties, it should monitor for updated versions of that software and plan for updates no later than three (3) months from the release of the update. IdenTrust may perform Linting on the corpus of its unexpired, un-revoked Subscriber Certificates whenever it updates the Linting software.

### Security Management Controls

IdenTrust has mechanisms in place to control and monitor the configuration of its CA, CSA, and internal RA Systems. IdenTrust installs its equipment and software in a controlled environment using a documented change control process. Software, when first loaded, is verified using file checksums provided by vendors at the file or file archive level. Upon installation time, and at least once every 24 hours, the integrity of the IdenTrust CA System must be validated.

Change control processes consist of a change control form that is processed, logged, and tracked for any changes to CA, CSA, and internal RA Systems, firewalls, routers, software, and other access controls. File modifications are controlled through the change control process. In this manner, IdenTrust can verify whether a change to the System has been evaluated for risk mitigation and authorized by management. Hashes for CA and CSA Systems files are recorded on installation and validated weekly thereafter as explained in the previous section. Host based intrusion detection is utilized to alert for changes to files. Notifications are monitored and are reviewed on a daily basis.

### Life Cycle Security Controls

No stipulation.

## Network Security Controls

The CA equipment used for PKI activities shall adhere to the NetSec BR.

IdenTrust implements a multi-tiered network utilizing the principles of defense in depth including network segmentation, multi-tiered security including security and high security zones, and redundancy. This infrastructure contains firewalls, proxy servers, and intrusion detection systems; and permits only encrypted access via VPN, SSH, or equivalent-security tools.

Issuing Systems, Certificate Management Systems, and Security Support Systems are located in a combination of Security and High Security zones.

Any accounts, ports, or protocols added to the firewall configurations are documented, authorized, tested, and implemented in accordance with the IdenTrust System Security Plan and other IdenTrust policies and procedures. Firewalls are configured with a minimum number of accounts. Only services and protocols required to support CA, CSA and RA functions are enabled. Firewalls and boundary control devices are configured to allow access only by the addresses, ports, protocols, and commands required for the trustworthy provision of PKI services by such Systems. IdenTrust blocks all ports and protocols by default, and opens only the minimum necessary to enable CA, CSA, and RA functions. Any network software present on firewalls is required to their function. All CA, CSA, RA, and Repository computer Systems are located in a secure facility behind the previously mentioned multi-tiered infrastructure.

IdenTrust's CA System is connected to one network and is protected against known network attacks. The IdenTrust Root is kept in a high security zone and in an offline state or Air-Gapped from all other networks and turned on under controlled conditions only when necessary for signing Subordinate CA Certificates.

RAs and their LRAs are required, under this TrustID CPS, to implement Network Security Controls that align with the policies outlined in this document.

## Time-stamping

IdenTrust's CA system clock time is derived from multiple trusted third party time sources in accordance with applicable requirements and is used to establish time-stamps for the following:

-   Initial validity time of a Certificate;

-   Revocation of a Certificate;

-   Posting of CRLs and CRL updates;

-   OCSP responses; and

-   System audit journal entries.

-   Time-Stamping Service responses

System time for servers providing CA and CSA services are updated using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) to synchronize system clocks at least once every 60 minutes. Trusted external time sources operated by government agencies are used to maintain an average accuracy of one second or better.

Clock adjustments are auditable events listed with other events in the log available for auditors.

##### ECDSA

The CA shall indicate an ECDSA Key using the id-ecPublicKey (OID: 1.2.840.10045.2.1) algorithm identifier. The parameters shall use theÂ namedCurveÂ encoding.

For ECDSA Key Pairs, IdenTrust use an ECDSA Key using the id-ecPublicKey (OID: 1.2.840.10045.2.1) algorithm identifier. The parameters use only one these namedCurveÂ encoding:

-   For P-256 keys, theÂ namedCurveÂ is secp256r1 (OID: 1.2.840.10045.3.1.7).

-   For P-384 keys, theÂ namedCurveÂ is secp384r1 (OID: 1.3.132.0.34).

-   For P-521 keys, theÂ namedCurveÂ is secp521r1 (OID: 1.3.132.0.35).

When encoded, theÂ AlgorithmIdentifierÂ for ECDSA keys is byte-for-byte identical with the following hex-encoded bytes:

#### Signature Algorithm Identifier

All objects signed by a CA Private Key shall conform to the TLS BR on the use of theÂ AlgorithmIdentifierÂ orÂ AlgorithmIdentifier-derived type in the context of signatures.

All objects signed by IdenTrust Private Key conform to TLS BR on the use of the AlgorithmIdentifierÂ orÂ AlgorithmIdentifier-derived type in the context of signatures.

In particular, it applies to all of the following objects and fields:

-   TheÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ field of a Certificate or Precertificate.

-   TheÂ signatureÂ field of a TBSCertificate (for example, as used by either a Certificate or Precertificate).

-   TheÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ field of a CertificateList

-   TheÂ signatureÂ field of a TBSCertList

-   TheÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ field of a BasicOCSPResponse.

No other encodings are permitted for these fields.

> 0500a203020140

In addition, IdenTrust may use the following signature algorithm and encoding if all of the following conditions are met:

-   If used within a Certificate, such as theÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ field of a Certificate or theÂ signatureÂ field of a TBSCertificate:

    -   The new Certificate is a Root CA Certificate or Subordinate CA Certificate that is a Cross-Certificate; and,

    -   There is an existing Certificate, issued by the same Issuing CA Certificate, using the following encoding for the signature algorithm; and,

    -   The existing Certificate has a uniqueÂ serialNumberÂ that is at least 64-bits long; and,

    -   The only differences between the new Certificate and existing Certificate are one of the following:

        -   A newÂ subjectPublicKeyÂ within theÂ subjectPublicKeyInfo, using the same algorithm and Key size; and/or,

        -   A newÂ serialNumber, of the same encoded length as the existing Certificate; and/or

        -   The new Certificate'sÂ extKeyUsageÂ extension is present, has at least one Key purpose specified, and none of the Key purposes specified are the id-kp-serverAuth (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) or the anyExtendedKeyUsage (OID: 2.5.29.37.0) Key purposes; and/or

        -   The new Certificate'sÂ basicConstraintsÂ extension has a pathLenConstraint that is zero.

-   If used within an OCSP response, such as theÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ of a BasicOCSPResponse:

    -   TheÂ producedAtÂ field value of the ResponseData must be earlier than 2022-06-01 00:00:00 UTC; and,

    -   All unexpired, un-revoked Certificates that contain the Public Key of the CA Key Pair and that have the same Subject Name must also contain anÂ extKeyUsageÂ extension with the only Key usage present being the id-kp-ocspSigning (OID: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9) Key usage.

-   If used within a CRL, such as theÂ signatureAlgorithmÂ field of a CertificateList or theÂ signatureÂ field of a TBSCertList:

    -   The CRL is referenced by one or more Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificates; and,

    -   The Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate has been issued one or more Certificates using the following encoding for the signature algorithm.

##### ECDSA

The CA SHALL use the appropriate signature algorithm and encoding based upon the signing Key used

IdenTrust uses the appropriate signature algorithm and encoding based upon the signing Key used.

If the signing Key is P-256, the signature must use ECDSA with SHA-256. When encoded, the AlgorithmIdentifier must be byte-for-byte identical with the following hex-encoded bytes: 300a06082a8648ce3d040302.

If the signing Key is P-384, the signature must use ECDSA with SHA-384. When encoded, theÂ AlgorithmIdentifier must be byte-for-byte identical with the following hex-encoded bytes:Â 300a06082a8648ce3d040303.

If the signing Key is P-521, the signature must use ECDSA with SHA-512. When encoded, the AlgorithmIdentifier must be byte-for-byte identical with the following hex-encoded bytes:Â 300a06082a8648ce3d040304.

### Name Forms

Each Certificate includes a unique serial number. Optional subject fields in a Certificate either contain verified information or are left empty. Certificates cannot contain metadata such as '.', '-' and ' ' characters or and/or any other indication that the value/field is absent, incomplete, or not applicable.

By issuing TrustID Certificates, IdenTrust CA represents that it followed the procedure set forth in this CP-CPS to verify that, as of the Certificate's Issuance date, all of the Subject Information was accurate.

Subject attributes shall not contain only metadata such as '.', 'â,' and ' ' (i.e., space) characters, and/or any other indication that the value is absent, incomplete, or not applicable.

### Name Constraints

The Issuing CA shall specify the format and content requirements for the names used in Certificates, including rules for subject and issuer names, as well as any constraints or conventions for representing those names.

IdenTrust may constrain the scope within which a Subordinate CA Certificate can Issue Certificates by using the Name Constraint extension.

For a Subordinate CA Certificate to be considered Technically Constrained, the Certificate includes an Extended Key Usage (EKU) extension specifying all extended Key usages for which the Subordinate CA Certificate is authorized to Issue Certificates . The anyExtendedKeyUsage KeyPurposeId does not appear within this extension.

The Certificate's Extended Key Usage extension will, at a minimum, contain the id-kp-serverAuth and may contain the id-kp-clientAuth.

In the case of Subordinate CA Certificates, for which the associated Private Key is under the control of an Issuing CA other than IdenTrust and that issues server Certificates, IdenTrust will include both the Name Constraint and Extended Key Usage extensions in the Subordinate CA Certificate.

### Certificate Policy Object Identifier

The Issuing CA must assert at least one Policy OID within each the Certificates it issues

Certificates issued pursuant to this CP-CPS may contain one (1) or more of the following OIDs:

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **TrustID Certificate Names, Types, and Policy OIDs**                                                           
  ------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- -------------------------- --------------------
  **Name**                                                **Type**                     **IdenTrust Policy OID**   **CA/B Forum OID**

### Policy Qualifiers Syntax and Semantics

No stipulation.

### Processing Semantics for the Critical Certificate Policies Extension

No stipulation.

## CRL Profile

Prior to 2024â03â15, the CA shall issue CRLs in accordance with the profile specified in the TLS BR or the profile specified in Section 7.2 of the [TLS BR v1.8.7](https://cabforum.org/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.8.7.pdf).

Effective 2024â03â15, the CA sha issue CRLs in accordance with the profile specified in Certificate Profile guideline specified in the [TLS BR Section 7.2](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#72-crl-profile).

A full and complete CRL is a CRL whose scope includes all Certificates issued by the CA.

A partitioned CRL (sometimes referred to as a "sharded CRL") is a CRL with a constrained scope, such as all Certificates issued by the CA during a certain period of time ("temporal sharding"). Aside from the presence of the Issuing Distribution Point extension (OID 2.5.29.28) in partitioned CRLs, both CRL formats are syntactically the same from the perspective of this profile.

Minimally, CAs must issue either a "full and complete" CRL or a set of "partitioned" CRLs which cover the complete set of Certificates issued by the CA within 7 days of such CA issuing its first Certificate. In other words, if issuing only partitioned CRLs, the combined scope of those CRLs must be equivalent to that of a full and complete CRL.

CAs must not issue indirect CRLs (i.e., the issuer of the CRL is not the issuer of all Certificates that are included in the scope of the CRL).

IdenTrust CRLs issued prior to March 15, 2023, are issued in accordance with the CRL Certificate Profile specified Section in the [TLS BR v1.8.6](https://cabforum.org/uploads/CA-Browser-Forum-BR-1.8.6.pdf).

IdenTrust CRLs issued on or after March 15, 2023 are issued in accordance with the Certificate Profile guideline specified in [Section 7.2 of TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#72-crl-profile), and published at [IdenTrust TrustID Document Library](https://www.identrust.com/support/documents/TrustID), under "Policies -- Current".

CRLs issued by IdenTrust comply with [Section 7.2 of TLS BR](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#72-crl-profile), , which incorporates, and is derived from RFC 5280. Except as explicitly noted, all normative requirements imposed by RFC 5280 shall apply, in addition to the normative requirements imposed by the TLS BR.

A full and complete CRL is a CRL whose scope includes all Certificates issued by the CA.

A partitioned CRL (sometimes referred to as a "sharded CRL") is a CRL with a constrained scope, such as all Certificates issued by IdenTrust during a certain period of time ("temporal sharding"). Aside from the presence of the Issuing Distribution Point extension (OID 2.5.29.28) in partitioned CRLs, both CRL formats are syntactically the same from the perspective of this profile.

Minimally, IdenTrust issues either a "full and complete" CRL or a set of "partitioned" CRLs which cover the complete set of Certificates issued by IdenTrust within 7 days of issuing its first Certificate. When issuing only partitioned CRLs, the combined scope of those CRLs must be equivalent to that of a full and complete CRL.

IdenTrust does not issue indirect CRLs (i.e., the issuer of the CRL is not the issuer of all Certificates that are included in the scope of the CRL).

### Version Number(s)

Certificate Revocation Lists must be of type X.509 v2.

IdenTrust issues X.509 version two (2) CRLs (i.e., populated with integer "1"). CRLs conform to RFC 5280. applicable subsequent updates via RFC 6818; these CRLs may contain the basic fields and contents specified below:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Signature Algorithm   sha256WithRSAEncryption, OID = 1.2.840.113549.1.1.11
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The correct signature algorithm depends on the algorithm used to sign the associated CA in accordance with [Section 6.1.5](#key-sizes).

### CRL and CRL Entry Extensions

CRLS must use CRL extensions that conform to RFC 5280 and other requirements as applicable such as the [TLS BR Section 7.2.2](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#722-crl-and-crl-entry-extensions).

#### CRL Issuing Distribution Point

When used, partitioned CRLs must conform to the requirements of the [TLS BR Section 7.2.2.1](https://cabforum.org/working-groups/server/baseline-requirements/requirements/#7221-crl-issuing-distribution-point).

## OCSP Profile

If an OCSP response is for a Root CA or Subordinate CA Certificate, including Cross Certificates, and that Certificate has been revoked, then the revocationReason field within the RevokedInfo of the CertStatus must be present.

The CRLReason indicated must contain a value permitted for CRLs, as specified in [Section 7.2.2](#crl-and-crl-entry-extensions).

### Version Number(s)

No stipulation.

### OCSP Extensions

TheÂ singleExtensionsÂ of an OCSP response must not contain theÂ reasonCodeÂ (OID 2.5.29.21) CRL entry extension.

# COMPLIANCE AUDIT AND OTHER ASSESSMENTS

The CA shall at all times:

1.  Issue Certificates and operate its PKI in accordance with all law applicable to its business and the Certificates it issues in every jurisdiction in which it operates;

2.  Comply with the CA/B Forum BR;

3.  Comply with the audit requirements set forth in this section; and

4.  Be licensed as a CA in each jurisdiction where it operates, if licensing is required by the law of such jurisdiction for the Issuance of Certificates.

IdenTrust has a regularly scheduled compliance audit mechanism in place to ensure that the requirements of this CP-CPS and the TLS BR are implemented and enforced. IdenTrust's SSP describes how the security features and controls of its Systems are to be tested and reviewed when significant modifications are made. IdenTrust is also subject to examination and the regulatory authority of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) under 12 U.SI Â§ 867(c). IdenTrust\'s commercial practices are audited as required by the OCC and states where IdenTrust is licensed as a CA. Full or partial audit results may be released to the extent permitted by law, regulation, and contract or IdenTrust management.

## Frequency or Circumstances of Assessment

An Issuing CA will undergo a review and approval process by the PMA to demonstrate compliance with this Policy. This Policy makes no stipulation as to the exact frequency of compliance inspections, but inspections for re-certification will be required anytime a significant change in Issuing CA operations is made. In any event, the Issuing CA, RAs, and CMAs must certify annually that they have at all times during the period in question complied with the requirements of this Policy. The Issuing CA, RAs, and CMAs must also state any periods of non-compliance with this Policy and provide reasons for non-compliance.

If the CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#_TOPICS_COVERED_BY), then, before issuing PubliclyâTrusted Certificates, the CA shall successfully complete a pointâinâ time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#_TOPICS_COVERED_BY). The pointâinâtime readiness assessment shall be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing PubliclyâTrusted Certificates and shall be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first PubliclyâTrusted Certificate.

IdenTrust has passed previous audits that have demonstrated compliance with this CP-CPS. IdenTrust may contract for periodic and aperiodic compliance audits or inspections of IdenTrust, Subordinate CA, or RA operations to validate that the subordinate entities are operating in accordance with the security practices and procedures described in the respective CPSs, Registration Practices Statements (RPSs), SSPs, and Privacy Policies and Procedures (PPPs).

IdenTrust Operations related to its own CA, CSA and RA are audited annually against the criteria of the WebTrust Program for Certification Authorities. (WebTrust for CA), developed by the American Institute for Certified Public Accounts and CPA Canada (formerly the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants). These audits provide an unbroken sequence of Audit Periods that shall not exceed one year in duration.

Certificates that are capable of being used to issue new Certificates are either (a) Technically Constrained in line with [Section 7.1.4](#name-forms) and audited in line with [Section 8](#compliance-audit-and-other-assessments) only in regards to self-audits, or (b) unconstrained and fully audited in line with all remaining requirements from the CA/B Forum BR. A Certificate is deemed capable of being used to issue new Certificates if it contains an X.509v3 basicConstraints extension, with the cA boolean set to true and is therefore by definition a Root CA Certificate or a Subordinate CA Certificate.

If the IdenTrust CA does not have a currently valid Audit Report indicating compliance with one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#topics-covered-by-assessment), then, before issuing PubliclyâTrusted Certificates, the CA shall successfully complete a pointâinâ time readiness assessment performed in accordance with applicable standards under one of the audit schemes listed in [Section 8.4](#topics-covered-by-assessment). The pointâinâtime readiness assessment shall be completed no earlier than twelve (12) months prior to issuing PubliclyâTrusted Certificates and shall be followed by a complete audit under such scheme within ninety (90) days of issuing the first PubliclyâTrusted Certificate.

## Identity/Qualifications of Assessor

The CA's audit shall be performed by a Qualified Auditor. A Qualified Auditor means a Natural Person, Legal Entity, or group of Natural Persons or Legal Entities that collectively possess the following qualifications and skills:

1.  Independence from the subject of the audit;

2.  The ability to conduct an audit that addresses the criteria specified in an eligible audit scheme (see [Section 8.4](#topics-covered-by-assessment));

3.  Employs Individuals who have proficiency in examining Public Key Infrastructure technology, information security tools and techniques, information technology and security auditing, and the third-party attestation function;

4.  Licensed by WebTrust;

5.  Bound by law, government regulation, or professional code of ethics; and

To perform the compliance audit, IdenTrust engages the services of a professional auditing firm having the following qualifications:

1.  **Focus and experience:** Auditing must be one of the firm's principal business activities. Moreover, the firm must have experience in auditing secure information systems and Public Key Infrastructures (PKI).

2.  **Expertise:** The firm must have a staff of auditors trained and skilled in the auditing of secure information systems. The staff must be familiar with PKI[^1], certification Systems, and the like, as well as Internet security issues (such as management of a security perimeter), operations of secure Datacenters, personnel controls, and operational risk management. The staff must be large enough to have the necessary depth and range of expertise required to audit IdenTrust's operations, or the Sponsoring Organizations with Enterprise RAs registration functions, in a competent manner.

3.  **Reputation:** The firm must have a reputation for conducting its auditing business competently and correctly.

4.  **Disinterest:** The firm has no financial interest, business relationship, or course of dealing that could foreseeably create a significant bias for or against IdenTrust (or the RA being audited). In the case of a Sponsoring Organizations with Enterprise RAs internal auditing group, the auditing group must be independent of the group being audited.

5.  **Rules and standards:** The firm must conform to applicable standards, rules, and best practices promulgated by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales (ICAEW), the International Accounting Standards adopted by the European Commission (IAS), Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), or another qualified auditing standards body, and must require its audit professionals to do the same.

In addition, the members of the firm's staff performing the audit are contractually subject to the following requirements:

1.  **Professional qualifications:** Each external auditing professional performing the audit must be a member of the AICPA, CICA, ICAEW, ISSA, (ISC)2, IIA, or ISACA. In addition, at least one staff member must be qualified as a Certified Information Systems Auditor, AICPA Certified Information Technology Professional (CPA.CITP) or have another recognized information security auditing credential.

2.  **Primary responsibility:** The external auditing professional assigned by the auditing firm to take the lead in the audit must have the audit as his or her primary responsibility until the audit is completed. That staff member and IdenTrust will agree on a project plan before beginning the audit to ensure that adequate staff, other resources, and time are provided.

3.  **Conformity to professional rules:** Each external professional active in auditing IdenTrust must conform to the ethical and other professional rules of the AICPA, CICA, ICAEW, ISSA, (ISC)2, IIA, or ISACA or those of the applicable other qualified auditing standards body.

4.  **Professional background:** The external professionals assigned to perform the audit must be trained to a standard generally accepted in the auditing field. They should also be familiar with PKI and other information security technologies and their secure operation. IdenTrust's operations are audited to ensure that IdenTrust conforms to this CP-CPS and familiarity with those documents is necessary for performing the audit for either IdenTrust or an RA. The auditor that IdenTrust has selected for past audits has in every case been one of the large, well-known auditing firms. IdenTrust expects to continue this practice while changing from time to time the specific firm selected and expects that its Assessor's Relationship to Assessed Entity

IdenTrust's compliance auditors are representatives from the OCC, independent security audit firms specializing in information systems and network security, and private, unaffiliated, and nationally recognized accounting firms.

IdenTrust has a contractual relationship with the auditing firm for the performance of the audit, but otherwise, auditors are independent, unrelated entities having no financial interest in each other. Auditors maintain a high standard of ethics designed to ensure impartiality and the exercise of independent professional judgment, subject to disciplinary action by their licensing bodies. The auditor(s) have no other relationships with IdenTrust or its officers and directors, including financial, legal, social, or other relationships that would constitute a conflict of interest.

IdenTrust will maintain these standards when conducting audits of Sponsoring Organizations with Enterprise RAs.

## Assessor's relationship to assessed entity

The Compliance Inspector(s) and IdenTrust establish a contractual relationship for the performance of the inspection to provide an unbiased, independent evaluation.

## Topics Covered by Assessment

IdenTrust's engagement of its Qualified Auditors as specified in [Section 8.2](#identityqualifications-of-assessor) requires them to audit IdenTrust's operations for conformity to this CP-CPS, and every Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between IdenTrust and other PKIs, if any.

The IdenTrust CA undergoes its annual audit in accordance with the "WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities" v2.2 or newer, and either

-   "WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities - SSL Baseline with Network Security" v2.7 or newer; or

-   "WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities -- SSL Baseline" v2.8 or newer and "WebTrust Principles and Criteria for Certification Authorities -- Network Security" v1.0 or newer.

incorporating periodic monitoring and/or accountability procedures to ensure that its audits continue to be conducted in accordance with the requirements of this audit scheme. See [Section 5.4, Audit logging procedures](#audit-logging-procedures).

SOC2 and CA WebTrust are performed by an accredited public accountant or nationally recognized accounting firm and any Auditing Standard audit must be performed by a Certified Information Systems Auditor or a Certified Information Systems Security Professional.

#### Opportunity of Owner to Correct Private Information

End Entities must be given access and the ability to correct or modify their personal or Organization information. IdenTrust or the RA must provide this information on appropriate requests, but only after taking proper steps to authenticate the identity of the requesting party.

### Information Treated As Private

Confidential information about Subscribers and their Subscribing Organization that is not publicly available in the contents of a Certificate, CRL, or in the LDAP Directory including information that links a subject pseudonym to the real identity of a Subject Individual is considered private.

All requests for disclosure of information considered confidential under [Section 9.4](#privacy-of-personal-information) must be made in writing. IdenTrust may choose to further define or restrict its disclosure of Certificate-related information. Unless prohibited by law, a PKI Service Provider will give all interested persons or parties reasonable prior written notice before disclosing any information considered confidential under [Section 9.4](#privacy-of-personal-information) Non-disclosure of confidential information will remain an obligation notwithstanding the status of a TrustID Certificate (current or revoked) or the status of IdenTrust.

### Disclosure Pursuant to Judicial or Administrative Process

Participants may be required to participate in, and bear financial responsibility for, a centrally administered Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process as outlined in of the TrustID CP.

No party is relying upon any warranty, representation, assurance, or inducement not expressly set forth herein and none shall have any liability in relation to any representation or other assurance not expressly set forth herein unless it was made fraudulently. Without prejudice to any liability for fraudulent misrepresentation, no party shall be under any liability or shall have any remedy in respect of misrepresentation or untrue statement unless and to the extent that a claim lies for breach of a duty set forth in this CP-CPS

### Assignment

Except where specified by other contracts, Participants may not assign any of their rights or obligations under this CP-CPS or applicable agreements without the written consent of IdenTrust.

### Severability

Should it be determined that one section of this CP-CPS is incorrect or invalid, the other sections of this CPS shall remain in effect until the CPS is updated. The process for updating this CPS is described in [Section 9.12.1](#procedure-for-amendment).

In the event IdenTrust becomes aware of a conflict between this CPS and a law, regulation, or government order (hereinafter \'Law\') of any jurisdiction in which IdenTrust operates or issues TrustID Certificates, IdenTrust will modify any conflicting requirement to the minimum extent necessary to make the requirement valid and legal in the jurisdiction.

This applies only to operations or Certificate Issuances that are subject to that Law. In such an event, IdenTrust will immediately (and before issuing a TrustID Certificate under the modified requirement) include a detailed reference to the Law requiring a modification of this CP-CPS under this section and the specific modification to this CPS implemented by IdenTrust. IdenTrust will also (before issuing a TrustID Certificate under the modified requirement) notify the CA/B Forum of the relevant information newly added to its CP-CPS by sending a message to <questions@cabforum.org> and receiving confirmation that it has been posted to the public mailing list and is indexed in the public mail archives available at <https://cabforum.org> (or such other Email Addresses and links as the Forum may designate), so that the CA/B Forum may consider possible revisions to this CP-CPS accordingly.

Any modification to IdenTrust practice enabled under this section will be discontinued if and when the Law no longer applies, or this CP-CPS is modified to make it possible to comply with both them and the Law simultaneously. An appropriate change in practice, modification to this CP-CPS, and a notice to the CA/B Forum, as outlined above, will be made within 90 days.

### Enforcement (Attorney Fees and Waiver of Rights)

No waiver of any breach or default or any failure to exercise any right hereunder shall be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or relinquishment of any future right to exercise such right. The headings in this CP-CPS are for convenience only and cannot be used in interpreting this CP-CPS.

Except where an express time frame is set forth in this CP-CPS, no delay or omission by any PKI Participant to exercise any right, remedy, or power it has under this CP-CPS shall impair or be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, or power. A waiver by any party of any breach of this CP-CPS shall not be construed to be a waiver of any other or repeated breach of this CP-CPS. Bilateral agreements between PKI Service Providers and other PKI Participants may contain additional provisions governing enforcement; provided, however, that in no event can such additional provisions alter the rights of IdenTrust hereunder.

### Force Majeure

IDENTRUST SHALL NOT INCUR LIABILITY IF IT IS PREVENTED, FORBIDDEN, OR DELAYED FROM PERFORMING, OR OMITS TO PERFORM, ANY ACT OR REQUIREMENT BY REASON OF: (I) ANY PROVISION OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW, REGULATION OR ORDER; (II) CIVIL, GOVERNMENTAL OR MILITARY AUTHORITY; (III) THE FAILURE OF ANY ELECTRICAL, COMMUNICATION OR OTHER SYSTEM OPERATED BY ANY OTHER PARTY OVER WHICH IDENTRUST HAS NO CONTROL; (IV) FIRE, FLOOD, OR OTHER EMERGENCY CONDITION; (V) STRIKE; (VI) ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR; (VII) ACT OF GOD; OR (VIII) OTHER SIMILAR CAUSES BEYOND ITS REASONABLE CONTROL.

## Other Provisions

### Legal Validity of Certificates

#### Waivers

No waiver by IdenTrust of any default by another entity on an obligation or duty under this CPS will operate as a waiver of any other default, or of a similar default on a future occasion. No waiver of any provision of this CPS by IdenTrust will be effective unless such waiver makes express reference to a waiver of a particular section or sections of this CPS and is made in writing and signed by an officer or director of IdenTrust.

To be legally valid, a TrustID Certificate must be issued in accordance with the TrustID CP, this CPS, and any applicable law.

#### Issuance

To be legally valid, a TrustID Certificate must be issued in accordance with the TrustID Policy and any applicable law.

#### Acceptance

The act of Acceptance will be logged by IdenTrust and may consist of a record made when the End Entity downloads the Certificate. Such act will be recorded and maintained in an auditable trail kept by IdenTrust in a trustworthy manner that comports with industry standards and any applicable laws or provisions of this TrustID CP-CPS, or related agreements.

#### Operational Period

A revoked or expired TrustID Certificate may not be used for any purpose. For revoked or expired Certificates, no action taken by an Authorized Relying Party will be considered valid for purposes of this PKI unless the Digital Signature of the Authorized Relying Party verification request is able to confirm that the Digital Signature in question was created during the Operational Period of a valid TrustID Certificate. Exceptions to the Private Key Usage period may be permissible if approved by the PMA and so long as such exceptions do not conflict with documented best practices, including RFC 5280 and the BRs.

#### Rules of Repose Allowing Ultimate Termination of Certificate

Unless otherwise specified by the Parties, reliance on a TrustID Certificate is no longer enforceable by an Authorized Relying Party against IdenTrust or RA 4 months after termination of the applicable Authorized Relying Party Agreement or 2 years after the Authorized Relying Party's validation of the TrustID Certificate with IdenTrust\'s Repository, whichever occurs first.
